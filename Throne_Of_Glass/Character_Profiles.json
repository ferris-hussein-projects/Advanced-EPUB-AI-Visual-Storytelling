        "Celaena inched toward the female figure.",
        "Celaena lay on the bed, staring at a pool of moonlight on the floor.",
        "She adjusted the green folds of Celaena\u2019s dress before kneeling down to brush the assassin\u2019s ruby-colored slippers.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re dismissed,\u201d Celaena said to Kaltain, flashing a bright smile.",
        "\u201cCelaena.\u201d",
        "The noise was strange, somehow more painful than receiving the blow, but Celaena thought little of it when he charged again and she met his weapon, parrying with ease.",
        "Celaena grimaced.",
        "Not surprisingly, Renault\u2019s favorite new activity was taunting Celaena.",
        "Her hand trembled with the effort to keep from driving the spearhead into his neck, but Celaena lifted her bruised face to the king.",
        "\u2022\nKneeling on the ground, Celaena gasped for breath, unable to find her way out of the hallucination and back into reality.",
        "\u201cDo you want to walk with me?\u201d Nehemia said in the common tongue to Celaena.",
        "With a shrug and glowing eyes, Celaena pulled out a handful of sweets.",
        "She shook Celaena\u2019s shoulders.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d Celaena said in Eyllwe, smiling for Nehemia\u2019s sake.",
        "Finally, he faced Celaena.",
        "There was a scream below, and snarling, and Celaena\u2019s stomach rose in her throat as she hurled herself upward.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena smiled to herself, running a finger across a neatly trimmed hedge.",
        "\u201cNot quite,\u201d said Queen Elena, helping Celaena rise from the chest.",
        "Not that Celaena was considering looking for it right now\u2014not when it could get her into trouble.",
        "But Celaena refused to back down.",
        "\u201cMiss Celaena!\u201d Philippa exclaimed from the doorway, gaping.",
        "It wasn\u2019t even about Dorian\u2019s pride anymore; Celaena wouldn\u2019t survive another year in Endovier.",
        "Celaena raised her chin as they entered the crowded room.",
        "Celaena held the candle aloft, her cape trailing behind her, leaving a clean wake on the dust-covered stairs.",
        "Elena then dropped to her knees and grabbed Celaena by the\u00a0shoulders.",
        "\u201cGet rid of her,\u201d she said flatly to Celaena, and then waved a hand toward Kaltain.",
        "She could hear her voice, and the voice of another, and then saw a hand extended from within a stall to beckon Celaena inside.",
        "Celaena fought to keep her hands from trembling as she flipped through the pages, searching for anything about the marks under her bed.",
        "Hands pulled Celaena from the saddle and set her on wobbly legs.",
        "Unfortunately, the same couldn\u2019t be said of Celaena\u2019s Eyllwe.",
        "Celaena clenched her hand.",
        "The nightmares were so terrible that Celaena barely slept, despite her pain and exhaustion.",
        "Celaena clenched and unclenched her right hand, watching the scars stretch and contract.",
        "But they were still in the middle of the Test\u2014still expected to complete it, and Celaena looked up.",
        "He moved his High Priestess, and Celaena laughed.",
        "An hour later, flanked by guards, Celaena held her chin high as they strode through the halls toward the library.",
        "Celaena almost sighed with relief, though it shamed her to feel that way.",
        "\u201cWith good reason,\u201d Celaena said, stepping over the legs of the Crown Prince and nearing the fifth pup.",
        "Celaena was unable to keep a hint of a smile from her lips.",
        "Celaena stopped at a window, leaning in close to the panes.",
        "His mouth was warm, and his lips were smooth, and Celaena lost all sense of time and place as she slowly kissed him back.",
        "Celaena found him waiting in her dining room when she emerged, her hair dripping water onto the floor.",
        "She reached to pinch Celaena\u2019s cheek, and Celaena pulled away.",
        "Celaena stroked her folded velvet-soft ears, then ventured low enough to scratch her chin.",
        "\u201cWhy?\u201d Celaena dared ask.",
        "Celaena struggled to maintain his gaze.",
        "Grumbling, Celaena slithered to the edge of the bed, dangling a hand over the edge to touch the floor.",
        "Celaena turned just in time to see one of the larger Champions\u2014one of the discharged soldiers\u2014shove a nearby guard, knocking him to the ground.",
        "\u201cFour months,\u201d Chaol said, \u201cafter Sardothien arrived, she attempted to flee.\u201d",
        "\u201cCelaena,\u201d Chaol said gently.",
        "Before someone could enter and notice, Celaena swept a foot over the tracks, destroying any trace, and stuffed the flowers into a nearby satchel.",
        "\u2022\nThe following dawn, Celaena\u2019s bedroom door opened, and a familiar stalking gait echoed through the room.",
        "Celaena rolled her eyes, and Chaol glared at her.",
        "Celaena issued a jolly laugh and crammed some of the candy into her mouth.",
        "Celaena translated again, and the princess nodded.",
        "Celaena remembered little of the next few moments.",
        "Celaena stiffened.",
        "The other Champions laughed again, and Celaena wanted nothing more than to smile with them.",
        "\u201cThat is the proper way to greet your future king,\u201d a red-faced man snapped at Celaena.",
        "Celaena smiled and rolled over.",
        "Celaena took a shuddering breath.",
        "Celaena opened her eyes, but stared at the wall across the room.",
        "For the next four days, Celaena awoke before dawn to train in her room, using whatever she could to exercise\u2014chairs, the doorway, even her billiards table and cue sticks.",
        "If Celaena was actually right about it, then whoever was responsible for killing the Champions could be among them.",
        "Celaena didn\u2019t need a mirror to know that she was covered in nasty bruises.",
        "\u201cThere are certain things that\u2014\u201d Celaena began, but the princess shook her head.",
        "Celaena frowned.",
        "To her left, a fireplace occupied most of the wall, and as Chaol led her farther into the room, Celaena tried not to stare at the thing.",
        "Celaena looked toward the bedroom door.",
        "It had been a while since someone had looked out for her, and Celaena had the feeling she could get used to it.",
        "Before Celaena could ask, someone curtsied in the middle of their path.",
        "Had Celaena lost her mind?",
        "Celaena\u2019s heart pounded so violently that she felt sick.",
        "\u201cA Wyrdmark,\u201d the princess replied, giving it a name in Celaena\u2019s own language.",
        "Celaena stifled a yawn.",
        "\u2022\nAfter dinner that night, Celaena sat across the chessboard from Dorian.",
        "Carefully putting his arms around Celaena, Dorian glanced toward Kaltain and Perrington.",
        "Standing before her reflection, Celaena wondered if she was seeing correctly.",
        "Celaena ran\u2014swifter than her young legs could manage.",
        "Celaena froze, her breath catching as Nox scraped his hands and feet against the stone to catch hold.",
        "Celaena held the dog at eye level.",
        "\u201cCruel? Celaena, Perrington is just over there.",
        "The nose instantly shot inward, and Celaena found the strange golden-haired pup quivering in a corner with a red bow around her neck.",
        "Celaena shot forward with a sweep of the staff.",
        "Chaol prodded her back and Celaena grabbed the arrow.",
        "Celaena smiled and took Ress\u2019s arm as he extended it to her.",
        "Celaena tried not to roll her eyes\u2014she\u2019d forgotten the woman was there.",
        "She touched the center of Celaena\u2019s forehead.",
        "Celaena almost fell out of her chair as she removed her feet from the table, and winced at the pain that shot through the wound on her leg.",
        "Celaena\u2019s dinner rose in her throat.",
        "Yards of silk, clouds of powder, brushes, combs, pearls, and diamonds glistened before Celaena\u2019s eyes.",
        "\u201cA soldier in the king\u2019s army,\u201d Celaena said, \u201cthough he now serves Duke Perrington.\u201d",
        "Celaena tried not to wince at the pain that shot through her shoulder and leg as she awoke.",
        "Celaena threw her dagger, and the blade clanged as it landed a hair\u2019s breadth from the one she\u2019d already embedded in the bull\u2019s-eye.",
        "\u201cI expected better,\u201d Cain said as Celaena crawled into a kneeling position, still clutching at her useless piece of wood.",
        "Celaena became aware of Nehemia\u2019s personal guards standing in the doorway, their eyes gleaming.",
        "It had fallen under the bed, and Celaena knelt upon the icy floor, straining to reach the book.",
        "Celaena swallowed, and did her best to look pleasant as she turned to Chaol, who observed them with raised brows.",
        "Celaena strained to reach the remnant of the staff, her vision flashing between the sunny veranda and the endless dark.",
        "She\u2019d taken a small tin of tar, and as Celaena rose from her crouch in the windowsill, her sticky, black hands and bare feet easily gripped the stone wall.",
        "Celaena moved.",
        "Celaena straightened as Nehemia suddenly rose from her seat beside the queen\u2019s throne, her guards snapping to attention.",
        "Celaena hit the ground and flipped, over and over and over, until she slammed into the clock tower.",
        "Celaena raised an eyebrow, and then, despite herself, smiled as he left the room as quickly as his feet could go without running, tripping slightly in the doorway as he staggered into the rooms beyond.",
        "Still staring at his outstretched hand, forever pointing toward an unreachable horizon, Celaena said a silent prayer for the dead Champion, and wished him well.",
        "Celaena tried to sit up a little higher, but found it too painful to even move an inch.",
        "Celaena pulled another book toward her and grinned.",
        "Celaena\u2019s eyes flew open.",
        "Celaena stalked between the two sarcophagi.",
        "Elena gave her a knowing smile that made her want to scream, but Celaena kept her face blank.",
        "I am Celaena Sardothien.",
        "\u201cWhat?\u201d Celaena asked.",
        "Celaena made herself look her in the eye.",
        "Celaena shot Philippa a sly look.",
        "Celaena\u2019s only response was to keep her feet moving.",
        "Their eyes met, and Celaena wondered why the woman smiled at her.",
        "An expression flashed across Celaena\u2019s eyes that bordered on fear and confusion.",
        "He was immensely pale, she noticed as he opened his mouth to say something, but Celaena continued down the hall.",
        "Celaena tipped back her head and laughed.",
        "Kaltain then looked away\u2014toward the tower, and Celaena followed her gaze and understood.",
        "The other soldiers nodded, and Celaena stiffened.",
        "Suddenly, she grabbed Celaena\u2019s hand and squeezed it.",
        "She yanked Celaena to the door.",
        "\u201cOh\u2014er, no,\u201d Celaena said, then switched back to Eyllwe.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena emerged a while later, clad in a solemn-looking green dress that Philippa had deemed the only appropriate gown for temple attendance.",
        "\u201cA connection?\u201d Celaena choked on the word.",
        "Nehemia examined the assassin, and Celaena knew she was taking in her clothes, her gait, her posture\u2014everything Celaena herself had observed about the princess already.",
        "Celaena glanced from her book to the tapestry on the wall.",
        "Celaena somehow knew it, too.",
        "Celaena gave him a mocking smile, and then returned her attention to the prince.",
        "\u201cListen,\u201d he began, and Celaena wanted to throw herself from the balcony.",
        "\u201cMy apologies, my lord prince,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "He yanked Celaena closer, but her feet seemed made of lead and she pulled against him.",
        "There was polite clapping, and Celaena noticed that Lord Garnel\u2019s face was set with fury.",
        "Celaena shook her head and the sound stopped.",
        "\u201cThank you,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "Sighing, Celaena lay back and closed her eyes.",
        "Celaena and Chaol didn\u2019t speak as they strode down the hallway, quickly moving from the throng of competitors and their sponsors, who lingered to speak with one another\u2014and size each other up.",
        "Celaena smiled weakly.",
        "He looked surprisingly plain, with mousy brown hair, tan skin, and average height, though Celaena had trouble not staring at his scar-flecked mouth.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena awoke with a gasp, a hand on her throat, cold sweat sliding down her back and pooling in the hollow between her mouth and chin.",
        "Gingerly, Celaena stretched out a hand.",
        "Welcome to my home, Celaena Sardothien.\u201d",
        "Celaena said something, to which the princess only waved a hand and strode past them and onto the sparring floor.",
        "Celaena could only follow after her.",
        "Celaena leaned her shoulder into the slab of stone.",
        "Celaena pushed back the covers.",
        "Whatever Nehemia thought of the flock of guards that followed Celaena everywhere, she didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "\u201cHappy Yulemas, Celaena,\u201d she said.",
        "\u201cI did it for my freedom,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "Celaena\u2019s shoulders sagged.",
        "\u201cTo you, Celaena.\u201d",
        "He grinned broadly at her, and Celaena bared her teeth.",
        "Icy rain kept them company for four days, during which time Celaena was so miserably cold that she contemplated throwing herself into a ravine, hopefully dragging Chaol with her.",
        "Celaena looked to her right, but all she saw was the tapestry that concealed the tomb.",
        "When Celaena finally collapsed onto a bed after her meeting in the throne room, she couldn\u2019t fall asleep, despite the exhaustion in every inch of her body.",
        "Celaena nodded.",
        "Celaena brushed a stray wisp of hair from her face and allowed herself to be led into the clearing.",
        "Celaena followed the princess through a large wooden door.",
        "Celaena was from Terrasen\u2014another conquered country, and his father\u2019s first conquest.",
        "A shudder went through Celaena, and she interrupted before Nehemia could say more.",
        "Through fading eyes, Celaena saw a crown of stars glittering atop Elena\u2019s head, her silver armor shining like a beacon in the blackness.",
        "Nehemia took Celaena\u2019s hand in her warm, dry one.",
        "Celaena blinked, remembering that he was beside her.",
        "Celaena sat up straighter in bed.",
        "Elena put a hand on Celaena\u2019s forehead.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s such a pity you are who you are,\u201d Philippa said, turning Celaena to face her.",
        "Celaena would not make a fool out of him!",
        "It was grinning\u2014grinning just as\u2014\nCelaena didn\u2019t have time to shout as it launched into flight.",
        "I am Celaena Sardothien, Adarlan\u2019s Assassin.",
        "Across the great hall, Nehemia sat with the Queen of Adarlan, occasionally glancing in Celaena\u2019s direction.",
        "Celaena sat on her bed, knees curled to her chest.",
        "Celaena found breathing a bit difficult as she asked, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d",
        "After a final sweep of the tomb, Celaena left.",
        "They completed their walk in silence, and when they parted ways, Celaena quickly wished Nehemia a pleasant evening before striding to her part of the castle.",
        "\u201cCelaena Sardothien, the King\u2019s Champion,\u201d he mused.",
        "Shame burned on Celaena\u2019s cheeks.",
        "Celaena bit her lip, but then quickly smiled.",
        "\u2022\nAfter hours of enjoying himself at the feast, Dorian entered Celaena\u2019s rooms, not sure what, exactly, he was doing in the chambers of an assassin at two in the morning.",
        "There was a sharp snap of rope breaking, and Nox\u2019s cry of fear and rage, and Celaena took off, sprinting across the backs of the four gargoyles before she launched herself into the void.",
        "She grasped Celaena\u2019s arms.",
        "Something groaned, and Celaena\u2019s head swung toward the back of the library.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m so sorry,\u201d Celaena whispered.",
        "I hoped you\u2019d still be awake,\u201d the Crown Prince said, and Celaena jumped from her seat to find Dorian approaching.",
        "Celaena went still.",
        "Celaena groaned as something cold and wet brushed her cheek and moved to lick her face.",
        "She\u2019d seen Nehemia\u2019s rooms; there were no signs of a demon beast lurking about, and nowhere in the castle where she could\u2014\nCelaena\u2019s eyes rose from the book.",
        "\u201cTo say the least,\u201d Celaena murmured, watching the shifting colors of the fading sun turn the castle gold and red and blue.",
        "She could only recall climbing the stairs, then concealing the secret door behind the tapestry\u2014\nCelaena gave a start and grabbed at her tunic, gaping as she found that it had somehow turned into a nightgown, and then marveled at her hand as she lifted it into the air.",
        "Huddled on the ground, hot tears slid down Celaena\u2019s face.",
        "Celaena laughed at something Dorian said.",
        "She gave one to Cain, then walked over to Celaena and handed the other to her before pausing in front of the king\u2019s table.",
        "Celaena did the calculations.",
        "Nehemia looked to Celaena.",
        "Celaena made to join the forming line, but Chaol grasped her shoulder.",
        "Celaena looked over her shoulder, past the guards and the supplies wagon, to the near-empty yard.",
        "Celaena eased farther up the pipe, her toes sticking to the metal.",
        "She wouldn\u2019t target Celaena, not when they\u2019d been friends.",
        "Celaena had already spent one blistering summer in the heat of the Red Desert, but to tell Nehemia that would only invite difficult questions.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena awoke the next morning to the wretched booming of the clock tower.",
        "Celaena awoke on Yulemas morning and relished the silence.",
        "Celaena felt her nostrils flare, and it was all Chaol could do to duck the apple she chucked at his head.",
        "Late that afternoon, Celaena stared at the ebony clock tower.",
        "Celaena opened her eyes.",
        "He only sheathed his sword and bowed his head to Nehemia as she clapped Celaena on the shoulder before she walked off.",
        "Alone, Celaena looked to the window and put a hand on her heart, whispering the word to herself again and again.",
        "\u201cShut your mouth, you damned pig,\u201d Celaena snapped.",
        "Celaena jabbed the cue, and hit the ball with such force that it zoomed toward the back wall of the table, knocking three colored balls out of its way before it collided with the number three ball, sending it shooting straight for a hole.",
        "\u201cCelaena Sardothien,\u201d she said flatly.",
        "She found Nehemia beaming at her, and Celaena lifted her staff a little in salute.",
        "When the clock chimed three and most of the guests\u2014including the queen and Chaol\u2014had left, Celaena finally decided that it was safe for her to leave.",
        "Water dripped somewhere, and Celaena looked longingly at the middle archway as she approached the crossroads.",
        "Celaena huffed.",
        "Celaena wasn\u2019t at all surprised.",
        "To his dismay, Celaena began speaking in Eyllwe to the princess, who stomped her staff.",
        "Shaking, numb, Celaena climbed back up the wall, leaving Nox to figure out the way on his own.",
        "Celaena curtsied, restraining the urge to keep walking; if she had to deal with too much courtly nonsense, she might be better off back in Endovier.",
        "Celaena observed her face; her lips were pursed, and the princess lifted her chin.",
        "But, if she were honest with herself, Celaena wasn\u2019t so sure anymore.",
        "Her legs gave out and Celaena collapsed.",
        "Standing on the wide veranda that encompassed the obsidian clock tower, Celaena tried not to shiver.",
        "Celaena stared at the sewer that ran past, flowing straight out of the castle.",
        "Even still, Chaol had to push his way through a crowd of gathered guards and servants, Celaena keeping close behind him.",
        "Picking Sardothien had been a gamble\u2014a bet against his father\u2019s tolerance.",
        "Cain stalked to where Celaena panted, her face white and red.",
        "With a shrug, Celaena handed the arrow to Chaol.",
        "\u201cAre all of your royal women like that?\u201d the princess said to Celaena in Eyllwe.",
        "Celaena gaped at the ground.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s voice was tinted with annoyance, and Celaena gave her friend an apologetic look.",
        "Celaena swallowed hard.",
        "Celaena took a deep breath and entered the ring.",
        "Celaena had once met a young woman from that cursed land, and though she\u2019d turned out to be both cruel and bloodthirsty, she was still just a human.",
        "The captain stopped in the open space before the throne, and Celaena halted with him.",
        "A slight smile spread on Celaena\u2019s lips.",
        "The dog stared at her, her wrinkled brow lifting, and Celaena smiled and set her down on the floor.",
        "Princess Nehemia cast a worried glance in Celaena\u2019s direction, but the assassin waved at her to resume her lesson with the Crown Prince.",
        "The moonlight fell upon her face, and Celaena\u2019s hand trembled as she reached out and touched the smooth, youthful cheek.",
        "They continued on, and Celaena saw another mark.",
        "Her long, silver hair flowed around her beautiful face, and she smiled as Celaena set down her miserably pathetic knife.",
        "Even though a necklace wouldn\u2019t protect her from the murderer, and even though Elena had some agenda she was being cagey about, Celaena wouldn\u2019t take it off.",
        "\u201cI should hope not!\u201d Celaena interjected.",
        "But Celaena was already running, running straight at those black,\u00a0rotting fangs.",
        "Celaena made a face.",
        "Celaena looked at the floor as the king stopped before her.",
        "Kaltain snapped her attention to Celaena.",
        "Celaena cocked her head as she approached the table.",
        "Celaena turned to Chaol.",
        "As they departed, Celaena looked back at the target.",
        "Celaena casually hid her hands in the folds of her gown.",
        "Don\u2019t disappoint me, Sardothien.\u201d",
        "Celaena wrapped a hand around the hard metal of the amulet.",
        "A shriek of rage ripped from her throat, and Celaena ran over to the pocket.",
        "Celaena squeezed her hand back.",
        "Celaena lifted her right hand so she could see the scars on it.",
        "Celaena eyed the pianoforte.",
        "Though her body almost seized up in agony as she turned over, Celaena put her injured hand on his stomach.",
        "Celaena remained with Chaol.",
        "Celaena touched Philippa\u2019s hand.",
        "Celaena didn\u2019t move from where she had fallen into the chest, despite her throbbing spine and legs.",
        "Applause rippled through the sponsors and trainers, and Celaena flashed an appreciative grin in the assassin\u2019s direction.",
        "She gestured at Celaena\u2019s body.",
        "It was a miracle Celaena bothered to acknowledge his existence\u2014or perhaps she\u2019d spent so long in Adarlan that she\u2019d stopped caring.",
        "The woman studied Celaena from beneath dark, shaped eyebrows.",
        "Most affectionately,\nDorian Havilliard\nCelaena laughed again and took the books from the woman\u2019s arms, thanking her for her trouble.",
        "The sound of crunching leaves and labored breathing filled the warm autumn air, and Celaena kept her gaze on the damp and gleaming dark hair of the thief in front of her.",
        "Celaena would have thanked her again, but another wave of cramping took over and she leaned forward as the door closed.",
        "He\u2019d enjoyed seeing Celaena the other night\u2014enjoyed it immensely.",
        "Yet an image came vividly to his mind: Nehemia handing Celaena her staff at the duel.",
        "Nehemia loved Eyllwe\u2014that was certainly true\u2014and Celaena knew there was nothing Nehemia wouldn\u2019t do to keep her country safe.",
        "\u201cYou truly came here to spy?\u201d Celaena whispered.",
        "Chaol cleared his throat beside them, obviously tired of being excluded from the conversation, and Celaena grinned at him.",
        "Sighing, Celaena called to her servants to draw her bath.",
        "Checking her irritation, Celaena strode to the mirror, Philippa bustling after her.",
        "Celaena watched her walk up the stairs, and didn\u2019t tear her gaze away until the princess was gone.",
        "She couldn\u2019t breathe fast enough, not as the door inside her mind opened and closed, and the images that Celaena had made herself forget flashed before her eyes.",
        "Celaena grasped her hand.",
        "Cursing, Celaena tried again.",
        "Celaena\u2019s brows rose.",
        "Celaena punched and kicked at the dummy, dodging invisible blows.",
        "\u201cWatch your mouth,\u201d Celaena snapped before she could think.",
        "Forcing herself to push aside her shame and worry, Celaena lifted her chin.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s gaze lingered on Celaena\u2019s brow for a moment before she grinned.",
        "Celaena smoothed the fur on her dress, frowning slightly.",
        "Celaena straightened as Philippa fixed a stray curl.",
        "Celaena hardly had the sense to lean her head away from the approaching stones, and the impact burst through her side and shoulder.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d Celaena admitted, \u201cyou might be right.\u201d",
        "Celaena\u2019s heart leapt into a gallop.",
        "\u201cWhat do you want?\u201d Celaena demanded, but kept her voice down.",
        "So Celaena spoke.",
        "Beyond the golden wall of light, the dead shrieked and moaned Celaena\u2019s name.",
        "Celaena reached around to touch her back, beneath her nightshirt.",
        "Celaena tried to pivot a free eye to the prince, but could only see a pair of black leather boots against the white floor.",
        "Celaena moved her head from the pillow to rest in the soft space between his shoulder and chest.",
        "Though no one mentioned another word about faeries, as they traveled onward, Celaena continually scanned the soldiers\u2019 faces for any indication that they\u2019d seen something strange.",
        "Celaena gripped the saddle horn.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d Celaena said hurriedly.",
        "His hands were covered in dirt, but before Celaena could better observe him, or his strange behavior, he nodded to Chaol and stalked away behind the tower.",
        "After a moment of silence, Celaena squared her shoulders.",
        "She didn\u2019t look at Celaena, nor did she move as she stood in the doorway.",
        "Queen Elena put her hands on Celaena\u2019s shoulders and kissed her forehead.",
        "Alone in her rooms, Celaena was about to see what her new companion was up to when the thought struck her:\nNehemia would be at the ball.",
        "Through the wall of Champions, guards, and their weapons, Celaena beheld Chaol kneeling by the unconscious guard.",
        "Celaena gave her a smile that only meant trouble.",
        "Celaena nodded and opened the gate for them.",
        "\u201cMy name is Celaena Sardothien,\u201d she whispered.",
        "Celaena seethed.",
        "As Celaena and Chaol entered the giant sparring room in the morning, she glanced at her competitors and remembered she wasn\u2019t the only one who hadn\u2019t a clue what to expect.",
        "There were many archways now, but Celaena chose to go straight, following the moisture that grew by the inch.",
        "Poor Celaena.",
        "\u201cGood night, Sardothien.\u201d",
        "Celaena straightened in her chair, rubbing a nasty bruise on her leg.",
        "Celaena scowled, and started sliding her feet along the cracks in the stone, looking for a foothold.",
        "Celaena\u2019s smile faded as the memory struck her.",
        "Celaena stared only at Chaol with those starlit eyes, and her long, white fingers floated through the air to meet his.",
        "Celaena now leaned over the edge of the balcony.",
        "Celaena turned to the princess.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re my dearest friend, Celaena.",
        "Celaena faced the tapestry.",
        "Nehemia leaned in to whisper in Celaena\u2019s ear.",
        "Philippa stormed toward Celaena.",
        "Celaena scooped the dog into her arms and kissed her head.",
        "Celaena lifted the jagged remnant of the staff in her hand.",
        "Celaena\u2019s eyes met with those of the princess and she dropped her hand.",
        "Celaena let out a shuddering breath.",
        "Celaena only glimpsed crimson cheeks and a sandy mustache before being thrown to the icy marble floor.",
        "Seated at the dining table, Celaena flipped through the book.",
        "It\u2019d been quickly agreed that while it was foolish of Celaena to spar with the princess, Chaol\u2019s absence was inexcusable, even with the dead Champion to investigate.",
        "Despite the fact that Yulemas was a month away\u2014and the final duel five days after that\u2014every evening, for an hour before dinner, Celaena and the princess divided their time equally between Eyllwe and the common tongue.",
        "Lillian Gordaina was Celaena Sardothien, the world\u2019s most notorious assassin.",
        "Elena held Celaena\u2019s face in her hands.",
        "And that, Celaena realized, was what Elena, the king\u2019s own ancestor, might want, too.",
        "Celaena suddenly halted.",
        "Brullo stood by the curtain, a scarred hand upon his sword, and Celaena studied the scene.",
        "Celaena could only gape as the flag was ripped down, and Cain howled his triumph.",
        "Celaena knew this long before she opened her eyes, and she eased her hand beneath her pillow, pulling out the makeshift knife she\u2019d crafted of pins, string, and soap.",
        "As Philippa arranged the last strand of Celaena\u2019s hair neatly around her face, secured a mask over her eyes and nose, and placed a small crystal tiara on her head, Celaena couldn\u2019t help but feel, despite herself, like a princess.",
        "Celaena only realized she was trembling when she made to step away, to flee as far and as fast as she could.",
        "Celaena found her arms covered in glowing turquoise marks\u2014Wyrdmarks.",
        "Celaena could have raked her nails down his face for staring at her like that, yet the fact that he\u2019d even bother to look when she was in such a filthy state . . .",
        "Nehemia chewed on the words and then looked to Celaena, brows high\u2014as if she\u2019d expected a translation by now.",
        "She pushed something cold and metallic into Celaena\u2019s hand.",
        "Celaena\u2019s hand trembled.",
        "Because if Nehemia had truly lied to her like that, and if Nehemia was murdering the Champions, then Celaena had to see it herself.",
        "You will not see the demons,\u201d said the queen, sketching marks on Celaena\u2019s brow.",
        "After nearly two hours of pampering\u2014trimming her hair, shaping her nails, and scraping away the callouses on her feet and hands\u2014Celaena grinned at the mirror in the dressing room.",
        "They thought Sardothien could defeat such a man if she wasn\u2019t drugged?",
        "The passage twisted and wound, and Celaena found herself descending a narrow set of stairs.",
        "But though she hadn\u2019t lost by any means, Celaena couldn\u2019t stand\u2014absolutely could not stand\u2014the feeling that she hadn\u2019t really won anything at all.",
        "Celaena hurried up the steps, her torch casting odd shadows on the walls.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena paced the length of the tomb, snarling to herself.",
        "Celaena translated Chaol\u2019s question with ease.",
        "Celaena clenched\u00a0the blankets.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena walked between the hedges, and couldn\u2019t help the smile that spread across her face.",
        "\u201cWhat is that awful noise?\u201d Celaena said.",
        "Celaena bristled.",
        "Chaol watched Dorian dip Celaena, watched the way her lips widened in a smile and her eyes burst with light as the Crown Prince said something.",
        "Celaena stumbled back, slamming into her dresser.",
        "Her gold jewelry pressed hard into Celaena\u2019s skin.",
        "The princess traced a mark on her hand, her fingers pressing into Celaena\u2019s skin.",
        "Curling on her side, Celaena\u2019s eyes grew heavier and heavier.",
        "Days passed without seeing Nehemia, and Celaena kept her mouth shut about the incident to Chaol or Dorian or anyone who visited her chambers.",
        "Celaena stood suddenly.",
        "When she was at last safely inside her chambers, Celaena crossed to her bedroom door and leaned there, panting, as she unlocked it.",
        "There was no smile on her lips, and Celaena shifted as she beheld the mistrust in the young woman\u2019s eyes.",
        "Celaena examined the gargoyle again.",
        "Celaena reentered the bedroom, yawning, and stood on the edge of the mattress to tuck the makeshift weapon into one of the folds of the partial canopy over the bed.",
        "Celaena pushed back the heavy folds of the work and tucked it behind a chest to keep it aloft.",
        "Celaena took a steadying breath, nestling farther into her pillows.",
        "Celaena Sardothien was his best and only choice now that Cain was dead.",
        "Celaena chewed on her lip.",
        "Though she had silver hair, her face was young, and her flowing white gown seemed to move in the moonlight; it\u2014\nCelaena sat up in bed.",
        "Just enough to weaken Sardothien\u2014to make her dizzy and disoriented.",
        "The following day, Celaena approached the glass throne, casting a wary glance about the council chamber.",
        "Celaena stared at her blankly, but then understood.",
        "In his arms, Celaena had gone utterly still.",
        "Nehemia strained as she carried Celaena into the bathing pool, where she stripped away Celaena\u2019s clothes.",
        "Celaena\u2019s hand burned when it touched the water, and she thrashed, but the princess held her firm, saying words in a tongue the assassin didn\u2019t understand.",
        "The world grew less dark; Celaena could see cracks of sunlight.",
        "It was irrational, Celaena knew.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m sorry,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "Celaena followed after her, unceremoniously stripping down to her underclothes and enjoying it far too much when Chaol\u2019s cheeks reddened before he turned away.",
        "Celaena kept still, as did Nox, who was standing close beside her.",
        "Celaena made a face and exposed her crimson teeth.",
        "Celaena beamed at her note and handed it to the nicest-looking servant she could find, with specific instructions to give it immediately to the Crown Prince.",
        "Nox cursed under his breath, and Celaena studied the other Champions.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m even gladder to have you guarding my back,\u201d Celaena said, fighting a yawn.",
        "Celaena glanced at the door again.",
        "\u2022\nA few days later, Celaena turned the crisp yellow pages of a heavy tome, squirming in her seat.",
        "Dorian spun Celaena with speed and dexterity, and she snapped into his arms, her shoulders rising with exhilaration.",
        "Unable to stop, Celaena wandered into the Land of Sleep.",
        "Celaena picked up the penultimate goblet and sniffed.",
        "Celaena paused in the doorway, nodding at the five guards who were posted outside, then looked back at Philippa.",
        "Even as he said it, she spotted him frowning at a passing courtier who looked too long in Celaena\u2019s direction.",
        "Celaena, despite herself, took a step away.",
        "The ridderak stalked back and forth on its four long, spidery limbs, sniffing at her, and Celaena paused.",
        "\u201cGood night, Celaena,\u201d he said.",
        "Celaena\u2019s eyes brightened, and she tilted her head back so she could see the castle looming above them.",
        "Hurrying farther, Celaena ignored the click of Ress\u2019s tongue as she rounded the corner.",
        "Celaena took a seat on the rail, and waved at the guards with their crossbows aimed at her.",
        "\u201cExcuse me?\u201d Celaena cocked her head.",
        "And, as Chaol\u2019s face paled, Celaena realized with a jolt that perhaps the Champions\u2019 killer and Elena\u2019s mysterious evil force might be one and the same.",
        "Celaena hit the landing, ran for the tomb door, and prayed to gods whose names she\u2019d forgotten, but who she hoped had not yet forgotten her.",
        "Celaena cocked her head as Nehemia emerged to stand along the sidelines of the large white circle.",
        "The girl smiled at Celaena and reached to touch the assassin\u2019s forehead.",
        "Her shoes seemed frail, and Celaena took a few steps back, ignoring the guards at the door as she lifted her feet high and set them down to test the strength of the shoes.",
        "Celaena looked at it, too.",
        "Celaena touched the amulet.",
        "The King of Adarlan had outlawed it all\u2014magic, Fae, faeries\u2014and removed any trace so thoroughly that even those who had magic in their blood almost believed it had never really existed, Celaena herself being one of them.",
        "She had tasted freedom, come so close to it, and now\u2014\nCelaena screamed as excruciating pain shot down her back, barely heralded by the crack of the whip.",
        "Philippa bustled toward the\u00a0dressing room, and Celaena watched her go.",
        "To Celaena\u2019s delight, Chaol blushed.",
        "His head shifted in her direction, and Celaena flashed him a grin.",
        "He moved into defensive position, and Celaena looked at him dully.",
        "How did Cain know these things about Celaena\u2019s past?",
        "She heard the crack before she felt the pain, and Celaena screamed, dropping to her knees as her shoulder dislocated.",
        "She reached for the hand mirror that Celaena kept by her bed and held it for the assassin to see.",
        "The princess grabbed Celaena\u2019s hand.",
        "He growled, but Celaena ignored him as she got to her feet.",
        "Dorian took Celaena\u2019s hand.",
        "Celaena gave the staff a few experimental sweeps in the space around her.",
        "Celaena swallowed the tightness in her throat and turned the page.",
        "\u201cI think it\u2019s useless arguing with her, Chaol,\u201d Celaena said, nudging the Captain of the Guard with her elbow.",
        "Like Celaena, no matter where Elena went, no matter how far, Terrasen would always own a part of her.",
        "\u201cYou know your history,\u201d said a light, female voice, and Celaena jumped, yelping as she tripped over a spear and fell into a gold-filled chest.",
        "But as the door closed behind the ivory train of the Eyllwe princess, Celaena wondered if she\u2019d been wrong.",
        "Crimson flags depicting gold wyverns flapped in the wind above the capital city, the cobblestone streets were cleared of traffic, and Celaena, unchained, dressed, painted, and seated in front of Chaol, frowned as the odor of the city met her nose.",
        "\u201cShe made another friend?\u201d Dorian said, raising his brows as Celaena demonstrated a move for Nox.",
        "But Celaena\u2014he didn\u2019t know how she felt.",
        "Nehemia let out a strangled sob, and a part of Celaena broke at the agony in the sound.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena stood before her balcony doors, staring down at Rifthold.",
        "Her hands drifted from Celaena\u2019s cheeks, and a white light filled the sky.",
        "Nehemia was still sitting with the queen, and hadn\u2019t looked again in Celaena\u2019s direction.",
        "The sunlight disappeared, the bloodbane seizing control of her mind again, and Celaena found herself before an army of the dead.",
        "The air had turned cold, and Celaena\u2019s skin prickled as his warmth vacated her body.",
        "Celaena frowned, but obeyed as he walked to her, Chaol stepping closer.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve just come from Her Majesty\u2019s side,\u201d said Kaltain, putting her back to Celaena.",
        "Celaena didn\u2019t quite understand the softness in the look he gave her as he nodded.",
        "Setting down her candle, Celaena crept toward the landing and peered inside the room.",
        "Celaena rapped a finger on the queen\u2019s pert nose.",
        "While the soldiers talked amongst themselves, Celaena took in their surroundings.",
        "Her stomach clenching, Celaena averted her eyes from the prisoners, keeping up with the captain as they headed to a caravan of horses near the towering wall.",
        "Celaena paused beneath the grate in the ceiling, peering up at the light flowing through it.",
        "\u201cCelaena.",
        "Celaena had Nehemia read from her library books, and then forced her to copy letter after letter until they looked flawless.",
        "And when the sound of his final shot stopped echoing in the suddenly silent chamber, Celaena\u2019s stomach turned over.",
        "Celaena took a steadying breath.",
        "At lessons, the knives remained Celaena\u2019s favorite, but the wooden staff became dear; naturally, it had to do with the fact that she could freely whack him and not chop off an arm.",
        "\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Chaol began, but Celaena silenced him with a wave of her hand.",
        "His happiness made her own face flush in response, and Celaena set down her candle.",
        "It was then that Celaena noticed the piece of paper in Nehemia\u2019s hands.",
        "Celaena felt anger bubble alongside the pain in her stomach.",
        "Tomorrow, he\u2019d have a word with her guards about letting Celaena out tonight.",
        "\u201cCongratulations, Celaena,\u201d he said quietly.",
        "Look at this mess!\u201d Celaena winced.",
        "A thought struck her, and Celaena tilted her head to the side.",
        "Beside Celaena, Chaol stood with his shoulders thrown back.",
        "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Celaena asked.",
        "But it was still warm, and it still smelled lovely, and so Celaena, with a bit of mustered courage, turned the handle.",
        "A few minutes later, Celaena frowned at herself as she hurried after the captain into the foyer.",
        "Celaena looked to Chaol, who nodded, taking the knives from her as they joined the twenty-three other competitors encircling the man.",
        "\u201cSomething to remember when fighting me, Sardothien,\u201d he panted.",
        "Celaena made a move to her friend, but her legs gave out, and she fell to the tiles.",
        "Panting, Celaena stepped back, surveying the tapestry.",
        "If Chaol spent so much time warning him about the dangers of associating with Celaena, what was he doing here in the middle of the night?",
        "Philippa ruffled Celaena\u2019s hair and left.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s a deal,\u201d Celaena said with a weak smile.",
        "Celaena opened the doors to her dressing room, surveying the glittering gowns hanging along the walls.",
        "\u201cWhy did you pretend to not understand our language all these months?\u201d Celaena asked, eager to change the subject, but also wondering why the question stung as much as her wounds.",
        "Celaena yanked the book back to her and stood with a jolt.",
        "Despite herself, Celaena felt badly for the boy.",
        "Was she warning Celaena to keep quiet about it?",
        "\u201cBegin!\u201d he roared, and Celaena shook her head, trying to clear her blurry vision.",
        "\u201cYou seemed rather friendly with Sardothien,\u201d Chaol said, his voice cold.",
        "Celaena scowled as the dance finished and the Crown Prince kissed the hand of the blond woman.",
        "She had two male guards with her, armed to the teeth with an assortment of curved Eyllwe daggers and swords, both of them studying Chaol and Celaena closely\u2014weighing the threat.",
        "Celaena turned on her side, and would have gladly fallen asleep again were it not for the metal that cut into her palm.",
        "Celaena paused for a moment before saying: \u201cHis brain.",
        "Her eyes burned, and Celaena put a hand to the amulet.",
        "Celaena tapped her foot on the floor, wondering how he had moved on to such a different subject.",
        "Celaena\u2019s throat tightened, and she put a hand on Nehemia\u2019s shoulder.",
        "Celaena whipped the staff through the air, hoping to catch him upon his unprotected neck.",
        "After a year of slavery in the Salt Mines of Endovier, Celaena Sardothien was accustomed to being escorted everywhere in shackles and at sword-point.",
        "\u2022\nChaol paced through his room, his time with Celaena over until she\u2019d train with the other Champions that afternoon.",
        "Philippa was already busy with the task of cleaning out Celaena\u2019s closet to accommodate more clothing.",
        "The creature sank back onto its haunches, poised to spring, and in that moment, Celaena came up with the most reckless and brave plan she\u2019d ever concocted.",
        "Celaena looked at her hands and realized she had wrung them so badly that her fingers were red.",
        "Celaena pushed a chair into the doorway\u2014it wouldn\u2019t do to have it slam shut on her and leave her trapped forever.",
        "Celaena buried her fingers in her velvet-soft ears.",
        "The red skirts were the size of a tent, and her bodice was so tightly bound that Celaena wondered if her waist were any more than sixteen inches.",
        "Skirts rustled from the doorway, and Celaena raised her eyes in the reflection to see Philippa enter behind her.",
        "Celaena looked up from an ancient book of Wyrdmark theories as the door creaked open, the hinges squealing loud enough to wake the dead.",
        "\u201cI think he killed him to defend Cel\u2014to defend the assassin.\u201d",
        "The princess suddenly stared into Celaena\u2019s eyes with a ferocity that made the assassin recoil slightly.",
        "A distinct howl shook the walls and made Celaena\u2019s blood icy.",
        "Celaena bowed carefully, not taking her stare from his face.",
        "\u201cAre these all hunting dogs?\u201d Celaena asked, but Nehemia had disappeared.",
        "It was a beautiful animal, and had Celaena not known better, she would have thought it purebred.",
        "Celaena began pacing.",
        "Grunting, Celaena pulled away with an effort of skill and force.",
        "Celaena could have sworn the young woman bristled.",
        "Chapter 9\nCelaena stood before the rosewood mirror, smiling.",
        "Celaena had been wrong to go to the ball last night, wrong to believe Nehemia was capable of such bad things.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s unnecessary,\u201d a woman said, and Celaena sat upright at the sound of Elena\u2019s voice.",
        "\u201cI\u2019d watch your tongues,\u201d Celaena snapped.",
        "Celaena glanced to the creature, to him, and then back.",
        "Celaena kept her hands pressed against the maroon bodice, trying not to wring them.",
        "Though Chaol might be Captain of the Guard, Celaena didn\u2019t doubt for a moment that Nehemia\u2019s guards would put him down if he became a threat.",
        "Suddenly, Celaena found herself standing at the white line, looking at the vast length of the room before her.",
        "Celaena grappled for a dagger, a candlestick, anything.",
        "They entered a part of the castle that Celaena had never seen before.",
        "The air chilled, and Celaena rubbed her arms.",
        "And Celaena was willing to bet a fortune that this was anything but a surprise\u2014the woman had probably been waiting here for a while.",
        "After hours of silence, Celaena turned to Chaol.",
        "Celaena couldn\u2019t help it\u2014she beamed.",
        "The clock chimed ten, and Celaena, seated at the small desk in her bedroom, looked up from her book.",
        "Celaena backed away from the ledge as they stopped at the nearby fountain.",
        "Nudging him with an elbow, Celaena grinned.",
        "Celaena looked at the servants cleaning.",
        "Celaena\u2019s head ached.",
        "Celaena stared at the moonlight as it streamed across the ceiling.",
        "Celaena watched as Cain struck, twisting his body so his right side was wide open.",
        "\u201cI\u2014\u201d Celaena began in the common tongue, and winced.",
        "\u201cIf you\u2019re lucky,\u201d Celaena purred, and walked away.",
        "An hour later, Celaena was beginning to curse herself for a being a fool.",
        "Celaena stared at the four dogs.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d Nehemia said a bit distantly, her brows knotting as she studied Celaena\u2019s brow.",
        "Celaena\u2019s limbs trembled so violently that she had to focus on gripping Nox, and her stomach turned over and over and over.",
        "Celaena let out a loud gasp to get Chaol\u2019s attention before she\u00a0slowed to a stop, and braced her hands against a tree trunk.",
        "Celaena winced as a gust of icy wind blew back her hood and froze her ears.",
        "Easing it out, Celaena unfolded the crumpled paper.",
        "The princess paused in the doorway, though, and tossed something to Celaena.",
        "Despite the pain, Celaena sat up.",
        "\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d Dorian asked sharply as Nox entered the room and walked over to Celaena.",
        "Elena was on her feet in an instant, blocking Cain\u2019s path to Celaena.",
        "Deciding that the moonlight must be bleaching it, Celaena shielded the spot with her hand.",
        "Dorian watched in wide-eyed terror as Celaena thrashed on the ground, waving away things they couldn\u2019t see.",
        "But Celaena remained watching the door, even after Chaol had shut it behind him.",
        "The iron-tipped head soared to the other side of the veranda, leaving Celaena with a piece of useless wood.",
        "He pointed to the loudmouthed thief that Celaena wanted to knock out cold.",
        "Celaena\u2019s blood went cold, and Nehemia quickly added, \u201cDon\u2019t worry.",
        "Celaena paused beside Elena\u2019s sarcophagus.",
        "Celaena felt ill at the thought of what else might be asked of her, but she nodded.",
        "The thief circled behind them, and Celaena straightened, wondering if they\u2019d actually pick a fight here.",
        "Celaena took the staff from Nehemia\u2019s hands.",
        "But Celaena whirled away.",
        "Yours most truly,\nCelaena Sardothien",
        "Celaena turned to the guards.",
        "Celaena\u2019s lovely visions exploded like dust from a slammed book.",
        "Celaena patted Chaol\u2019s arm as she took it in her own.",
        "Nehemia let out a low groan, but thanked Chaol before turning to Celaena.",
        "Celaena dreamt.",
        "Celaena dropped into the lowest curtsy she could give without falling and said in Eyllwe, \u201cWelcome to Rifthold, Your Highness.\u201d",
        "Celaena couldn\u2019t keep her eyes from the castle.",
        "But, locked in that dark, horrible world, Celaena only saw the ancient queen barrel into Cain, knocking him down, before the dead charged.",
        "Celaena faced forward, pushing those thoughts from her mind as they entered the passage through the wall.",
        "Right now, his focus was on solving the murders of the Champions, and on making sure Celaena won.",
        "Celaena took a step closer to him.",
        "Chapter 29\nAt their Test the next afternoon, Celaena stood in the training hall with her arms crossed, watching Cain spar with Grave.",
        "After cutting short their lesson in favor of a stroll, Celaena and Nehemia walked through the spacious halls of the castle, guards trailing behind them.",
        "Celaena\u2019s back began sweating as she felt hundreds of eyes upon her.",
        "And though Celaena had stopped shaking, she could still hear the shriek and thump of Ned Clement hitting the ground.",
        "The women screamed, the guards whirled with their crossbows pointed, and Celaena looked skyward as she retreated from the rail and into the shadows of the balcony doorway.",
        "Celaena nodded and cleared her throat.",
        "Though Celaena might be his father\u2019s Champion, she\u2019d gained the title using a weapon from Eyllwe.",
        "It was then that she heard Nox shout, and Celaena looked in time to see Grave shove him from their perch atop the gargoyle\u2019s back.",
        "Dorian couldn\u2019t blame her for that, though, not after he\u2019d seen the horror that was Endovier, and the destruction it had wrought upon Celaena Sardothien\u2019s body.",
        "\u201cYour poor mother,\u201d Celaena said, half-smiling.",
        "No other Champions were murdered, thankfully, but Celaena still found herself looking over her shoulder constantly, even though Chaol seemed to consider the two murders to be just unfortunate incidents.",
        "\u201cGo!\u201d she suddenly cried, herding Celaena toward the door to the hall.",
        "Celaena threw more logs onto the fire, quickly changed into her nightgown, and slid into bed, clutching her makeshift knife.",
        "Celaena soon found herself before the other two portals.",
        "Celaena studied the left- and right-side passages.",
        "Celaena gave her a stiff nod.",
        "\u201cWhat religion?\u201d Celaena asked.",
        "Nox said something to Celaena that set her chuckling.",
        "Celaena sighed, rolling her shoulders.",
        "Ress cleared his throat, and Celaena looked up to see Dorian standing outside her rooms, chatting with the guards.",
        "Celaena\u2019s brows lowered.",
        "\u201cOr maybe you\u2019re just too busy visiting Sardothien\u2019s rooms in the middle of the night.\u201d",
        "Nehemia was staring at her forehead, and Celaena asked, \u201cIs there dirt on my face?\u201d",
        "Celaena could only manage a nod to the princess as they turned their attention to the hall ahead.",
        "\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said an older, female voice, and Celaena pivoted, the yards of cumbersome fabric twisting with her.",
        "Celaena closed her book and sighed.",
        "Celaena\u2019s toes scratched Fleetfoot\u2019s ears.",
        "Dorian almost dropped his drink as he saw Celaena Sardothien atop the stairs.",
        "Celaena\u2019s warning cry was carried away by the wind as Grave set about sawing Nox\u2019s rope from its tether on the gargoyle.",
        "\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Chaol said, stepping forward, a subtle movement to keep himself between Nehemia and Celaena.",
        "Celaena raised an eyebrow.",
        "A step fell behind them, and before Celaena could whirl, a male voice said: \u201cLook at this.\u201d",
        "Celaena, unsure how she\u2019d ever sleep again now that she knew what Cain could do, had been grateful for the company.",
        "\u201cHello,\u201d Celaena said in Eyllwe.",
        "Celaena clenched her hands into fists, pushing them hard against her ribs.",
        "\u201cShe says you can return to your cushions and dancing and leave us be,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "Celaena clenched her book.",
        "Celaena\u2019s arm trembled with effort as she pulled the string back a bit farther and fired.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena tasted blood as Cain seized her again, dragging her across the floor.",
        "Celaena trembled.",
        "After a solitary supper, over which she contemplated all of her planned escape routes and how she might make more weapons for herself, Celaena paced through her rooms.",
        "Celaena didn\u2019t hear him, and though they talked for a good hour afterward meandering through the grounds, she couldn\u2019t get her heart to calm.",
        "Celaena\u2019s head whipped around, her eyes full of long-forgotten fury that made her belly ache and twist.",
        "\u201cI suppose,\u201d he drawled, turning those brilliant blue eyes on Celaena, \u201cthat it will be difficult for Lady Lillian and I as well.",
        "And so, struggling and shaking, Celaena stood.",
        "Celaena\u2019s face burned.",
        "Celaena could only gape as the servant woman shuffled away.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s clear that you respect me, Duke Perrington, but it\u2019s a bit unnecessary to put such effort into forcing Celaena Sardothien to have the same opinion.",
        "Celaena examined the gloved hand holding her arm.",
        "While Celaena could listen to Nehemia rant about the King of Adarlan for hours, they were in a garden\u2014other people might be listening.",
        "In short, Celaena Sardothien was blessed with a handful of attractive features that compensated for the majority of average ones; and, by early adolescence, she\u2019d discovered that with the help of cosmetics, these average features could easily match the extraordinary assets.",
        "So Celaena only smiled at them, tossed her hair, and batted her eyelashes at the prince\u2019s back.",
        "Celaena lifted her gaze to find the sapphire eyes of the Crown Prince of Adarlan studying her face.",
        "Celaena wanted to hug him.",
        "Despite her attempt to keep her breathing steady, Celaena gasped for air as she ran beside Chaol in the game park.",
        "Celaena looked at the stone coffins.",
        "\u201cCelaena, you\u2019re grimacing.\u201d",
        "Taking that as a sign that she could clear out of the ring, Celaena stalked to where Chaol stood and took up a place beside him.",
        "Celaena sniffed the water goblet again, racing through a list of odorless poisons.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t know how to properly teach you my language,\u201d Celaena lied.",
        "He swung, but Celaena struck, ramming her fist into his arm, sending the blade soaring through the air.",
        "Celaena put a hand against her heart.",
        "Celaena rolled her neck and lifted one of the goblets to her nose, sniffing.",
        "Though she rolled her eyes and slammed the door, Celaena found herself humming throughout her meal.",
        "Celaena cleared her throat.",
        "\u201cRest well, Celaena,\u201d he said.",
        "Celaena turned to her own goblets before Brullo could catch her.",
        "And that reminds me\u2014you won\u2019t be competing as Celaena Sardothien.\u201d",
        "Celaena grunted as she pushed the chest to the side and folded the tapestry back from the wall.",
        "Celaena shifted uncomfortably at the words.",
        "Celaena returned to her starting side and picked up the cloak.",
        "He knew jealousy when he saw it, and while Dorian was clever, he was just as bad as Celaena at hiding his emotions.",
        "Celaena\u2019s eyes stung as she spotted the guards loitering in armchairs in the great room.",
        "She might have her faults, but Celaena never did anything half-heartedly.",
        "As it shifted beneath her, Celaena winced.",
        "Celaena strode to the balcony and flung open the doors, embracing the chill air.",
        "\u201cShame on you, Your Highness!\u201d Celaena chided, concealing her wicked amusement beneath a giggle.",
        "Celaena rushed down a staircase, then strode along a hallway lined with books.",
        "Celaena panted as she and Nox lowered their swords, the Weapons Master shouting at the five Champions to get some water.",
        "Celaena felt each of her heartbeats hammering in her veins as Nehemia wove through the crowd, her guards close behind\u2014and halted in front of Celaena and Chaol.",
        "\u2022\nSomething in Chaol began fraying as Celaena raised her bloodied face to look at Cain.",
        "Celaena swallowed the lump in her throat.",
        "\u201cWhere?\u201d the captain asked, jangling Celaena\u2019s chain for Dorian to notice.",
        "Celaena began to climb back over.",
        "But in that one sentence, Dorian made his mistake, and he knew\u00a0that his father had found his new weak spot: the overwhelming terror that Celaena would be ripped from him.",
        "\u201cYou think I want to be here?\u201d Celaena shouted, even though it made her head pound.",
        "No\u2014the king wouldn\u2019t bother to care about that kind of thing, especially if Celaena might soon be his Champion.",
        "Her foot slipped on a slick rung, and Celaena barely stifled her cry as she gripped the bars, cursing as her knee banged into the gate.",
        "Dorian crossed his arms as Celaena scooped up the dog.",
        "Midbite, Celaena tore her focus from the prince to study the trees.",
        "Celaena scanned the table.",
        "Celaena swung her leg through the air, connecting with the dummy\u2019s head.",
        "Celaena clutched the necklace.",
        "Celaena gave the servant a sharp look.",
        "It came crashing down upon her, and Celaena dropped the bloody remnant of the staff on the ground as she removed her foot from Cain\u2019s back.",
        "\u2022\nBy that afternoon, a vicious rainstorm arrived, and Chaol permitted Celaena to walk around the castle with him after she\u2019d finished training with the other Champions for the day.",
        "\u201cGood,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "It was not pure white, but rather a grayish offset, and its wide skirts and bodice were encrusted with thousands of minuscule crystals that reminded Celaena of the surface of the sea.",
        "Though a bolt of fear went through her at the thought, though standing against the king was the one thing Celaena had thought she\u2019d never be brave enough to do, she couldn\u2019t forget the three scars on her back, or the slaves she\u2019d left in Endovier, or the five hundred butchered Eyllwe rebels.",
        "Celaena strode into her bedroom, wringing her fingers.",
        "The captain rose and drummed the pommel of his sword before calling to a servant as Celaena walked into her bedroom.",
        "The prince straightened, keeping his attention on Celaena.",
        "Celaena scooted up another few feet, her fingers aching.",
        "Celaena shifted from one foot to the other, wishing she hadn\u2019t demanded that Chaol give her the aisle seat.",
        "Celaena studied Kaltain\u2019s narrow, narrow waist.",
        "Celaena\u2019s upper lip pulled back from her teeth as the servant turned from the room.",
        "Celaena knew the name\u2014she had often heard the Eyllwe slaves in Endovier boast of Nehemia\u2019s beauty and bravery.",
        "Most of the talk Celaena had overheard yesterday was immensely dull, and she didn\u2019t expect much as the women neared.",
        "Celaena smiled slightly as Fleetfoot wagged her tail and licked Nehemia\u2019s arm.",
        "Atop the hill, Celaena stared at the crowning achievement of Adarlan.",
        "Then Celaena laughed, and Dorian kept staring at her.",
        "Celaena almost cried aloud as she saw them: the pointed, arched ears.",
        "\u201cYou saw the body?\u201d Celaena asked him.",
        "\u201cWell, we\u2019re very important and very busy,\u201d Celaena said to him, linking elbows with the princess.",
        "Inch by inch, it swayed away, until\u2014\nCelaena bit down her laugh.",
        "Celaena glanced to the right to find Pelor, the gangly young assassin, watching her.",
        "Her throat constricting, Celaena tucked the piece of paper into her pocket and hurried back toward the great room, the Wyrdmark drawn on the paper burning a hole in her clothing.",
        "The woman cursed so colorfully that Celaena clamped a hand over her mouth to keep from laughing.",
        "\u201cIs it . . . is it possible to go to these other worlds?\u201d Celaena vaguely recalled the Wyrdgates that she\u2019d stumbled across in that book months and months ago.",
        "\u201cNo, but I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll have a lovely time,\u201d Celaena said, then switched into Eyllwe and said something else.",
        "Celaena struggled to control her breathing.",
        "Seeing the annoyance in the princess\u2019s eyes, Celaena felt a shred of pity for whatever man her father chose.",
        "And Celaena would never be that stupid.",
        "Celaena slammed shut the book.",
        "Celaena ran her fingers along the smooth curve of her yew bow.",
        "\u201cNasty brute,\u201d Celaena breathed, still staring in the direction in which he\u2019d disappeared.",
        "Celaena\u2019s right leg could barely support her, but she gritted her teeth and rose.",
        "Celaena pulled her cloak tighter around her as she followed after the princess.",
        "\u201cAnd you\u2019re Celaena Sardothien, Adarlan\u2019s greatest assassin.",
        "The princess chewed on her bottom lip, and Celaena noted that her fingers curled and uncurled at the sides of her long, white gown.",
        "Celaena bit down her laughter.",
        "Cain swung his sword at Celaena, who threw herself backward\u2014but not fast enough.",
        "Hiding her scowl, Celaena crossed her arms as well and began her vigil.",
        "But the breeze stirred again, and it blew so hard toward the far right arch that Celaena took a step.",
        "Bristling, Celaena shook her head and took another small forkful of food.",
        "Which, to Celaena\u2019s delight, was usually everyone.",
        "Celaena set down her candle, removed her cloak, and emptied her pockets.",
        "Her skull ached with the impact, but Celaena\u2019s cry of pain was cut short as she opened her eyes to the dark and saw what appeared.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena stood in the tomb, and knew she was dreaming.",
        "Chaol took another step toward Nehemia\u2014effectively blocking Celaena\u2019s path to Kaltain.",
        "\u201cExactly how I look,\u201d Celaena said, her mouth aching at the movement.",
        "Celaena\u2019s legs had become so stiff that Chaol was forced to help her onto her horse.",
        "Endless gratitude to my agent and very own Champion, Tamar Rydzinski, who understood Celaena from page one.",
        "Her hands suctioned onto the stone, and Celaena heaved herself upward just in time to hear a shriek, a thump, and then silence, followed by the shouting of onlookers.",
        "There was a bounce to her step as Celaena walked on, the court fading away behind them.",
        "Still, Celaena had difficulty leaving the chamber.",
        "Celaena and Chaol rose and stepped aside.",
        "Celaena blinked at the light as she looked, from high above, at the feast in the Great Hall.",
        "Cain\u2019s attention was on Celaena as he said, \u201cYou were brought here\u2014all of you were.",
        "It was lunchtime when Brullo released them for the day, and to say that Celaena was hungry would be a severe understatement.",
        "The doors to her bedroom banged open, and Celaena was on her feet in an instant, a candlestick in hand.",
        "Smirking, Celaena braced her blackened feet on a stabilizing bracket holding the pipe in place.",
        "\u201cIt was originally a defense,\u201d Nehemia said, gently setting her hand on Celaena\u2019s good arm.",
        "\u201cNo more dawdling!\u201d the servant woman cried, and almost knocked Celaena off her feet as she pushed her out the doorway and slammed it shut.",
        "Green skin and yellow fangs flashed before her eyes, and Celaena\u2019s aching fingers curled into a fist.",
        "Celaena\u2019s heart twisted.",
        "\u201cOh!\u201d Celaena exclaimed, smiling.",
        "\u201cWhere in Erilea did you find this dress?\u201d Celaena murmured.",
        "Celaena caught the princess\u2019s eyes lingering on the few scars on her hands.",
        "Celaena gave her most winning smile.",
        "Celaena pushed back the covers, sugar spraying into the air.",
        "Celaena eliminated her options one by one, seeing each weapon for what sort of damage she might do to the captain\u2019s face.",
        "Celaena jolted a bit at that.",
        "Philippa approached, ignoring Celaena\u2019s glower as she adjusted the folds of the assassin\u2019s gown, fluffing them in the right places.",
        "Celaena tried not to wince as she slid backward in the saddle.",
        "Then Dorian\u2019s gaze met hers, and Celaena\u2019s blood turned into shooting stars.",
        "With more dignity than Celaena had expected, Renault got to his feet and bowed to the king, mumbling his thanks.",
        "Celaena examined the clock for a second more.",
        "Celaena stayed in the doorway.",
        "Celaena straightened, her chin rising.",
        "Celaena\u2019s white cloak made her easy to spot, and Dorian could always be noticed by the empty circle of space around him.",
        "Nehemia frowned at Celaena.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re wearing your gown, Celaena.\u201d",
        "She walked to Celaena, and it was all the assassin could do to keep from backing out of the tomb and running away.",
        "Without saying a word to Celaena, he strode up the steps to the palace, his red cape blowing in the wind.",
        "Celaena turned just in time to see the slender golden snout protruding from the basket, inching toward the candy.",
        "Celaena rested her cheek against her knee, listening to the clock tick-tick-tick long into the night.",
        "Kaltain gave Celaena a vicious little smile.",
        "Moving through her room, trembling with excitement, Celaena gathered two balls of yarn from Philippa\u2019s sewing basket, along with three sticks of chalk and one of her makeshift knives.",
        "He parried Celaena\u2019s attack with a brush of his blade.",
        "Celaena smiled as she watched the Crown Prince of Adarlan lead the Princess of Eyllwe through the basic steps of fencing.",
        "Celaena swallowed hard, and Chaol lowered his sword, taking a step back from them.",
        "Celaena groaned.",
        "The poison left Celaena\u2019s body.",
        "As he pivoted, Celaena vomited all over the floor.",
        "After shutting the whining Fleetfoot out of the bedroom, Celaena covered the passage entry with the tapestry, wedged a book in the doorway to keep from getting locked in, and only once wished she had a weapon beyond the candlestick she carried and the makeshift knife in her pocket.",
        "Celaena offered her a slight smile, and the princess stepped closer, her guards tensing slightly.",
        "Celaena gripped the hilt of a dagger so hard that it hurt.",
        "\u2022\nAt her Test the next day, Celaena studied the small table before her and all the goblets it contained.",
        "Celaena smiled smugly to herself as she nodded to a passing nobleman, who raised his eyebrows at the sight of her.",
        "From her place at the back of the balcony, Celaena could still see as the woman in red brushed a hand down the front of her skirts.",
        "\u201cAnd is he as handsome as his older brother?\u201d Celaena smirked as Chaol tensed.",
        "He bent under the guise of adjusting his boot, and Celaena saw a small dagger glint in the sunlight.",
        "She\u2019d changed\u2014she now wore a gown of white and gold that, despite herself, Celaena greatly admired.",
        "Celaena listened to the wind howl.",
        "Celaena\u2019s teeth were, of course, still red, and now she felt queasy as she stared at the bag of candy.",
        "Celaena dangled from the stone wall of the castle, her legs trembling as she dug her tar-covered fingers and toes into the cracks between the giant blocks.",
        "Nox and Celaena remained by the table.",
        "\u201cThis is she?\u201d the Crown Prince of Adarlan asked, and Celaena\u2019s head whipped around as the captain nodded.",
        "Needing no more encouragement, Celaena staggered up the stairs.",
        "The world began to spin and tilt, and Celaena closed her eyes.",
        "Celaena\u2019s nails dug into her palms.",
        "\u201cGo,\u201d said the queen, shoving Celaena into the hallway.",
        "Still, Chaol understood enough to bristle, and Celaena could hardly contain her glee.",
        "Philippa knelt to polish the lump of crystal on Celaena\u2019s silver slippers.",
        "Celaena remained before the door, watching as it galloped at her, sparks flying from its claws as they struck stone.",
        "Stiffly, knowing that many eyes were upon her, Celaena dropped into a low bow, her skirts whispering.",
        "\u201cYulemas blessings to you,\u201d the girl said, and Celaena nodded her thanks.",
        "Brows narrowed, Celaena aimed the cue at the white ball.",
        "Celaena made a small noise and began shaking.",
        "The Eyllwe princess stood perfectly still, her brown eyes wary as she took in Celaena and her companion.",
        "\u201cCrime isn\u2019t an accomplishment, Sardothien.\u201d",
        "There was something calming and familiar about the queen\u2019s face, something that reminded Celaena of the rose smell.",
        "Celaena peeled her cheek from the marble but lay on the floor until he stood and left.",
        "\u201cYou look troubled,\u201d Nehemia said when Celaena reached her side, and put a hand on her arm.",
        "Still, as the clock marked the passing hours, Celaena kept her vigil\u2014waiting, wondering what truly lurked in the castle, and unable to stop thinking of those five hundred dead Eyllwe rebels, buried in some unmarked grave.",
        "\u201cI imagine you\u2019ve had a long journey,\u201d Celaena continued in Eyllwe.",
        "Ice moved through Celaena\u2019s veins.",
        "To honor her, Celaena realized, her eyes stinging.",
        "Celaena watched her go.",
        "\u201cMy name is Celaena Sardothien.\u201d",
        "\u201cFine,\u201d Celaena said, but glanced down at herself.",
        "Celaena blinked at the request\u2014feeling, despite herself, honored.",
        "Make your final order,\u201d Brullo said, and Celaena stared at her line of goblets for a moment longer.",
        "\u201cWhen I\u2019m training\u201d\u2014she kissed the pup\u2019s soft head, and the dog nestled her cold nose against Celaena\u2019s neck\u2014\u201cI want her in the kennels, training as well.",
        "Celaena shot Nehemia a look, but the princess\u2019s eyes remained upon Cain\u2014narrowed, but her lips strangely slack.",
        "When the woman returned half an hour later with a stack of books piled in her arms, Celaena laughed as she swiped the note that crowned the column of leather.",
        "\u201cOf course I want her,\u201d Celaena said, then realized what the implications would be.",
        "Celaena wanted to punch her.",
        "Fleetfoot climbed over Celaena\u2019s sore legs to greet the princess.",
        "The clock chimed eleven and Celaena stretched, but then stopped as pain seized her stomach.",
        "Celaena ran her tongue across her teeth, trying not to laugh.",
        "It was clear Cain and Celaena would ultimately face each other, and until then . . . well, the other Champions weren\u2019t worth his time.",
        "Celaena gingerly touched his back.",
        "Nauseated, Celaena wrapped her arms around her knees.",
        "Though she\u2019d never admit it, Celaena didn\u2019t really know what to expect at their first Test.",
        "A door shut somewhere inside her rooms, and Celaena jumped, the book flying from her hands.",
        "And he couldn\u2019t deny that he was aching to learn what Celaena\u2019s lips felt like, what her bare skin smelled like, how she\u2019d react to the touch of his fingers along her body.",
        "She laughed when Chaol, irked at how Celaena stood in front of the mirror for five minutes, admiring herself, half-dragged her out of\u00a0the room.",
        "Celaena glanced at Pelor, whose hazel eyes shone as she lifted the glass of wine to her lips and drank a sip.",
        "\u201cIf you\u2019re so willing,\u201d Celaena said, and the princess grinned.",
        "Just as Celaena was about to launch herself and her knives at the captain, someone stomped a spear on the ground and called the room to attention.",
        "\u201cHave a lovely night, Miss Sardothien.\u201d",
        "Deciding that scowling at him wouldn\u2019t be the wisest decision, Celaena looked instead toward the massive castle gates.",
        "Celaena waited until the sounds of his fleeing footsteps faded, then hurried back to her own rooms.",
        "\u201cVerin Ysslych,\u201d Celaena said before the guard could reply.",
        "Hungry by the time a plate was finally laid in her lap, Celaena became a bit more than irritated when the captain did not immediately remove her irons.",
        "So Celaena smiled and rolled her shoulders as she said brightly: \u201cShove it up your ass, Cain.\u201d",
        "The following morning, Celaena walked beside Chaol, her eyes on the marble floor of the hallway.",
        "The king looked her over, and Celaena willed herself to remain upright, to stand tall as he judged.",
        "Celaena opened her mouth, but no words came out.",
        "\u201cBut it makes no difference if my name\u2019s Celaena or Lillian or Bitch, because I\u2019d still beat you, no matter what you call me.\u201d",
        "Still, Celaena paused beside Elena\u2019s sarcophagus and looked at the beautiful face carved from marble.",
        "Celaena knew she should keep moving, but something kept her rooted to the spot.",
        "Celaena didn\u2019t wait for his answer as she strode toward the gaming room.",
        "Celaena opened and closed the doors of her armoire, dresser, and vanity.",
        "Celaena approached the rail again and peered over.",
        "\u201cOf course,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "Celaena yawned, but nodded with the rest of the congregation as the choir gave their blessings.",
        "\u201cAt least he\u2019s dead,\u201d Celaena offered, then swallowed.",
        "Celaena left the window, but stopped before the tapestry and its depiction of Queen Elena.",
        "\u201cYou,\u201d he began, then stopped as Celaena faced him.",
        "Celaena stumbled back from the woman and slammed into the wall.",
        "Even Celaena had taken to jumping at every strange sound.",
        "He patted his sword hilt, and Celaena had to admire the beautiful woven gold of the pommel.",
        "And, Celaena realized, through Georgina, Nehemia would also get the King of Adarlan\u2019s ear.",
        "\u201cGood-bye, Celaena.\u201d",
        "\u2022\nAn hour later, sweating and still panting from the swordplay practice, Celaena wiped her brow on her sleeve as they made their way back to her rooms.",
        "But after learning about the fate of those rebels, the princess was spending most of her time in her rooms, and had declined Celaena\u2019s repeated offers to go for walks.",
        "Celaena said nothing and pushed her carrots around on her plate.",
        "\u201cDo me a favor, Celaena,\u201d Nox said.",
        "Carefully, as if approaching a sleeping person, Celaena walked to the large instrument.",
        "\u201cCelaena,\u201d he breathed, his voice laced with pain\u2014and hope.",
        "Celaena was half-asleep on her horse when the Crown Prince pulled out of line and came trotting toward them, his dark hair bouncing.",
        "Celaena closed her eyes and smiled.",
        "Celaena glanced at her nightgown and blushed as she noticed him staring at her bare legs.",
        "Celaena cursed herself for it, but hastily attached the chain around her neck.",
        "Celaena opened an eye and frowned as Dorian sat on her bed.",
        "When Celaena\u2019s frown didn\u2019t disappear, Elena said, \u201cYou don\u2019t trust me yet.",
        "Chapter 37\nSeated in a pew in the rear of the spacious temple, Celaena kept her mouth closed so tightly that it hurt.",
        "Good-bye, Celaena.\u201d",
        "Celaena hid her smirk this time.",
        "All the clothing Celaena planned to buy when she was free to venture into Rifthold and do some shopping for herself, once she had her outrageous salary as King\u2019s Champion. Which she\u2019d hopefully start receiving as soon as she signed her contract . . . whenever that would be.",
        "They emerged from the floor, and just above Celaena\u2019s head they met in a\u2014",
        "When he failed to respond again, Celaena couldn\u2019t help but feel a bit foolish.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m not who I pretend to be,\u201d Celaena said quietly, unable to meet her friend\u2019s eyes.",
        "Celaena gasped and awoke.",
        "Celaena\u2019s breathing became a bit difficult.",
        "Given what she\u2019d heard of Nehemia, Celaena didn\u2019t think that was the entirety of it, but she smiled politely as she said, \u201cHow long will you remain in Rifthold?\u201d",
        "\u201cYou should leave it alone,\u201d Nehemia said sharply, and Celaena blinked.",
        "\u201cYou know her?\u201d Celaena raised an eyebrow.",
        "\u201cIf I didn\u2019t know better, I\u2019d call myself a Faerie Queen.",
        "Lightheaded and immensely heavy all at once, Celaena faced the room.",
        "It was a long while before Celaena slipped into an uneasy sleep.",
        "Celaena looked to Chaol.",
        "Her hair, long and wavy, spilled around her head and tumbled over the side of the lid, so lifelike that Celaena could have sworn it was real.",
        "Chaol leaned closer, and Celaena leaned to meet him as he whispered: \u201cYou sound like a raving lunatic.\u201d",
        "Celaena grunted, throwing punch after punch, left-right-left-left-right.",
        "Celaena nodded, pain replacing panic.",
        "Celaena crept to her bedroom window, pressing herself against the marble wall, and glanced down.",
        "Celaena leaned back in her seat and propped her feet on the table, balancing the chair precariously on its hind legs.",
        "Celaena hurtled into the room, and saw only her bed before everything went dark.",
        "The demons shrieked, and Elena stretched out a hand, golden light bursting from her palm, forming a wall between them and the dead as she rushed to Celaena\u2019s side and cupped her face in her hands.",
        "Celaena slammed the book shut and stepped away from the table.",
        "Celaena was held in place.",
        "And maybe Celaena had wanted a friend\u2014wanted someone as different and outsiderly as she was.",
        "Celaena covered her head as they swept upon her, and she kicked blindly.",
        "Celaena shot forward, as fast as an arrow of Deanna.",
        "Most of the thousands of slaves in Endovier received similar treatment\u2014though an extra half-dozen guards always walked Celaena to and from the mines.",
        "Celaena\u2019s heart gave a screech and dove behind her spine.",
        "He should stay away from Celaena\u2014Chaol had enough to worry about.",
        "Knowing how the story always went, Celaena lifted the candle to the arches above the portals, looking for any inscriptions regarding the sure death that would meet her if she walked beneath a specific arch.",
        "Celaena looked piteously at the dog, which was now licking the sugar off her fingers.",
        "Celaena smirked.",
        "Celaena felt as if she\u2019d barely closed her eyes when a hand jabbed her side.",
        "\u2022\nCelaena\u2019s eyes opened.",
        "Celaena made a disgusted face, her nose crinkling.",
        "Celaena glanced over her shoulder at Chaol, who gave his prince an apologetic look.",
        "Celaena made a disgusted noise and sat back, seething.",
        "Celaena\u2019s heart tightened.",
        "Celaena blinked, then slowly said: \u201cYou\u2019re awfully bold.",
        "Celaena shivered.",

        "\u2022\nWhen she was safely back in her rooms after the Test, Celaena watched the snowflakes drift from the hills beyond Rifthold.",

        "Celaena swallowed.",
        "Heat flared, and a blue light flashed across Elena\u2019s face as Celaena\u2019s mark burned and then faded.",
        "\u201cNehemia?\u201d Celaena asked, getting to her feet.",
        "Chaol left her, and Celaena didn\u2019t wait to hear the door shut before closing herself in her bedroom.",
        "\u201cAnd I\u2019m afraid the Wyrdmarks don\u2019t help,\u201d Celaena said.",
        "\u201cIf it won\u2019t respond to humans, then it will have to be killed,\u201d Dorian said offhandedly, and a spark went through Celaena.",
        "Celaena drew another dagger, but paused as Verin called to her from the ring where he sparred with Cain.",
        "Celaena stepped closer as the guards shuffled out, shutting the door.",
        "Wind tore at her, but Celaena kept her focus on Nox, falling so fast, so far from her outstretched hands.",
        "Choosing the book that seemed the most interesting, Celaena flipped onto her back and began to read.",
        "Pulling her hand from Chaol\u2019s, Celaena straightened her spine as she stepped into the ring.",
        "Celaena sat by a window in her bedroom, watching the snow dance in the night air.",
        "Celaena\u2019s face burned with shame beneath the mask.",
        "Celaena only smiled back at him and nodded.",
        "\u201cAs do you,\u201d Celaena said tightly.",
        "It reeked, almost like soil, and Celaena\u2019s nose crinkled as she turned the pages.",
        "\u201cYes, I am!\u201d Celaena said through her teeth, pulling the bowstring back even farther.",
        "Celaena glanced between Chaol\u2019s sword and her friend\u2019s weapon.",
        "Celaena scratched her behind the ears and ran a hand along the page of the book.",
        "Celaena passed the Tests\u2014stealth and\u00a0tracking\u2014without drawing much attention to herself or risking her neck to save anyone.",
        "Celaena clutched her candlestick tighter, and pulled her makeshift knife out of her pocket.",
        "The clock struck nine, and Philippa glanced toward the doorway, giving Celaena the opportunity to slip her makeshift knife down her bodice without being noticed.",
        "She stared at Celaena\u2019s elaborate gown.",
        "Celaena couldn\u2019t help but notice the sharp stares from the same women when they beheld her in the prince\u2019s retinue.",
        "When Nehemia had left, Celaena smiled, despite all that she had just learned, and closed her eyes.",
        "Celaena rubbed an eye and then scratched the dog behind the ears.",
        "Celaena set the dog down on the bed.",
        "After his father had allowed Cain to toy with and hurt Celaena for so long, when she\u2019d clearly been drugged . . .",
        "Through the pain, Celaena began laughing.",

        "Celaena shifted her gaze to the dancers.",
        "Celaena stumbled, her calloused feet slipping on the smooth floor as she straightened herself.",
        "Celaena was picking at her dinner, slouched in her seat.",
        "She wondered if Kaltain\u2019s presence meant that Duke Perrington had told her who Celaena truly\u00a0was.",
        "Celaena squared her shoulders and stepped forward.",
        "Celaena slumped into a chair.",
        "Slowly, not wishing to find herself swinging from the gallows just yet, Celaena bowed, too.",
        "Celaena supposed she liked him.",

        "Her hand rose to Celaena\u2019s forehead and she drew an invisible mark.",
        "Celaena\u2019s feet stumbled, but she stayed upright as she dared a glance at the lady, and the goblets on the table before her.",
        "So, I highly suggest, Miss Sardothien, that you get your arrogance in check before you end up back in the mines.\u201d",

        "For weeks now, Duke Perrington had been pushing for a plan to bring more forces into Eyllwe\u2014to crush the rebels so efficiently that they wouldn\u2019t dare challenge Adarlan\u2019s rule again.",

        "\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a good idea,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "Were it not for Chaol, he would have felt immensely lonely.",

        "\u201cI\u2019m getting a drink,\u201d muttered Chaol, and walked away.",
        "Chaol\u2019s features softened.",
        "Her eyes were far away and distant, and though she didn\u2019t look at Chaol, she felt him studying her face.",
        "Chaol stood nearby, just watching.",

        "They\u2019d sat in silence until some semblance of reality returned, and then left without a word, not waiting for Chaol to thank them.",
        "Without thinking, without understanding, Chaol leapt between them and plunged his sword through Cain\u2019s heart.",
        "I\u2019ll see you in the hall for dinner tonight,\u201d was all Chaol said before he headed to his rooms.",
        "Even though she was ashamed of herself for believing such awful things about Nehemia, knowing that Dorian and Chaol were safe made the misery worth it.",

        "\u201cI\u2019m sure you don\u2019t,\u201d Chaol said dryly, though he met her stare.",
        "\u201cWe\u2019re to dine this evening,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "She faced Chaol, who swung a leg over his horse.",
        "Captain Westfall was not excessively handsome, but she couldn\u2019t help finding the ruggedness of his face and the clarity of his golden-brown eyes rather appealing.",
        "Chaol stretched his legs beneath the table and shifted his attention back to Perrington.",
        "Chaol kept his gaze ahead of them.",
        "She just prayed all that running with Chaol would keep her from tiring before him.",

        "To her left, a fireplace occupied most of the wall, and as Chaol led her farther into the room, Celaena tried not to stare at the thing.",
        "When Chaol came to fetch her the next morning, he found her sleeping on the floor, wrapped in a blanket.",
        "Why did Chaol never joke with her as Dorian did?",
        "She intercepted Chaol as soon as she crossed the line of chalk.",
        "It might be worth it just to see the expression on Chaol\u2019s face.",
        "\u201cHow are you doing, Captain Westfall?\u201d Otho said, clapping him on the back a bit too hard.",
        "If Captain Westfall insisted on protocol, then she\u2019d give it to him in abundance.",
        "Chaol smiled slightly.",
        "But Chaol only gaped at the flailing assassin, his face pale as death.",
        "Chaol just provoked her . . . though he had his good side, too.",
        "\u201cStop it, now,\u201d he said to Chaol as his friend rose from his spot near the ring.",
        "When she didn\u2019t say more, Dorian asked as casually as he could: \u201cOn that note, how are you and Chaol getting along?\u201d",
        "Chaol watched them, somewhat disbelievingly.",
        "Chaol prodded her back and Celaena grabbed the arrow.",
        "\u201cDon\u2019t you agree, Captain Westfall?\u201d",
        "No other Champions were murdered, thankfully, but Celaena still found herself looking over her shoulder constantly, even though Chaol seemed to consider the two murders to be just unfortunate incidents.",
        "Around dawn, Chaol usually showed up for breakfast.",
        "She gave Chaol a quick glance, daring him to challenge her claim, but Dorian answered.",
        "Chaol hid his glower at Dorian\u2019s tone.",
        "Chaol leaned back in his chair, sipping his water.",
        "Cain was so large\u2014he was a mountain, and his blows . . . they made Chaol seem like a child . . .",
        "But Chaol saw.",
        "Chaol\u2019s heart pounded wildly, but he could do nothing to help her.",
        "Celaena swallowed, and did her best to look pleasant as she turned to Chaol, who observed them with raised brows.",
        "\u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d asked Chaol, and she explained the gist of their conversation.",
        "The Crown Prince shook his head when Chaol reached for her.",
        "Silence fell, and half of the guards encircled the Champions, hands on their swords, while the others, Chaol included, rushed to the dead Champion and fallen guard.",
        "Even with the mask on, Chaol could see the happiness written across her face.",
        "\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Chaol said, stepping forward, a subtle movement to keep himself between Nehemia and Celaena.",
        "\u201cSit down,\u201d Chaol growled, pulling at her green gown.",
        "Chaol reined in his disgust and anger.",
        "\u201cSo you won\u2019t punish Chaol?\u201d",
        "Tucking them into her fur-lined pockets, she approached Chaol, who was standing near the edge of the giant chalk circle that had been drawn on the flagstones.",
        "Every noise woke her, and Chaol hadn\u2019t yet discovered who might be targeting the Champions one by one.",
        "Chaol glared at her before speaking.",
        "\u201cCaptain Westfall?\u201d said the courtier who had spoken earlier.",
        "\u201cRelax, Chaol,\u201d he said, and his hand slipped to rest on her back, his fingers grazing her bare skin.",
        "\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Chaol hissed softly.",
        "Chaol remained silent until they entered the stone castle, when he turned to her.",
        "She chewed on her bottom lip, quiet for a heartbeat, before she asked: \u201cDid Chaol give the order to kill Sven?\u201d",
        "Chaol\u2019s hand drifted to where his sword should have been.",
        "\u201cMind your mouth,\u201d Chaol warned from beside her.",
        "Even Perrington had seen her when Chaol dragged her into that corner.",
        "Chaol, thankfully, caught the general gist of it.",
        "Chaol tilted his head to the side.",
        "\u201cI wonder what your father will think of her,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "\u201cThere\u2019s no blood in these claw marks,\u201d she said, twisting her head to look over her shoulder at Chaol.",
        "Dorian faced her as Chaol left.",
        "Was that what Chaol had wanted to ask her before she vomited\u2014a true invitation to the ball?",
        "Despite her attempt to keep her breathing steady, Celaena gasped for air as she ran beside Chaol in the game park.",
        "When Chaol didn\u2019t bother retorting, Dorian asked: \u201cDo you think someone wants to kill all the Champions?\u201d",
        "Their eyes met, and Chaol didn\u2019t hide his smile as she grinned at him.",
        "Taking that as a sign that she could clear out of the ring, Celaena stalked to where Chaol stood and took up a place beside him.",
        "Chaol looked to Kaltain.",
        "The sword, obviously, was the wiser choice\u2014and for Chaol to offer his own weapon made her feel strangely lightheaded\u2014but the staff . . .",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re doing exactly like we planned,\u201d Chaol went on.",
        "\u201cIt makes me sick, too,\u201d Chaol murmured, glaring at the floor.",
        "Nausea gripped her, but Chaol took her by the elbow and escorted her to the far end of the veranda.",
        "She had a hard time looking at Dorian as Chaol nodded to the prince and left her chambers.",
        "Chaol should be doing more important things right now.",
        "It somehow made sense that Chaol\u2019s family ruled Anielle.",
        "Chaol stretched again, lifting his arms over his head.",
        "She couldn\u2019t warn Chaol\u2014because if she were wrong, then it would ruin not just her friendship with Nehemia, but also the princess\u2019s efforts at diplomacy.",
        "He pulled up alongside Chaol.",
        "Captain Westfall jerked his chin at the two guards standing on either side of the doors, and they stomped their spears in greeting.",
        "Celaena and Chaol didn\u2019t speak as they strode down the hallway, quickly moving from the throng of competitors and their sponsors, who lingered to speak with one another\u2014and size each other up.",
        "When they were out of hearing distance, he demanded, \u201cWhere\u2019s Chaol?\u201d",
        "And while she\u2019d be more than happy if some dark force somehow destroyed Cain, Perrington, the king, and Kaltain Rompier, if Nehemia, or even Chaol and Dorian, were somehow harmed . . .",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d Chaol said, fiddling with the long hunting knife at his side.",
        "\u201cThe Lady Lillian and Captain Westfall are very close companions,\u201d Dorian said dramatically.",
        "\u2022\nDorian and Chaol didn\u2019t say much as they walked to dinner in the Great Hall.",
        "Behind her, Chaol spoke to the servant girl.",
        "She hadn\u2019t seen Nehemia since the ball last night, hadn\u2019t dared to approach her, or tell Chaol what she\u2019d learned.",
        "As she made to follow Chaol, she noticed a tile on the paved pathway.",
        "Chaol bowed low.",
        "Chaol, standing beside her, did the same.",
        "Icy rain kept them company for four days, during which time Celaena was so miserably cold that she contemplated throwing herself into a ravine, hopefully dragging Chaol with her.",
        "When it was over and Cain\u2019s eyes stopped seeing him, Chaol\u2019s sword clattered to the ground.",
        "She broke her stare with Cain and glared up into Chaol\u2019s face.",
        "Celaena felt each of her heartbeats hammering in her veins as Nehemia wove through the crowd, her guards close behind\u2014and halted in front of Celaena and Chaol.",
        "\u201cWhat you did for me, Chaol,\u201d she tried again.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re squirming already,\u201d Chaol said under his breath.",
        "\u201cIf you consider that sort of gracelessness equal to swordsmanship . . . what sort of fighting do you do, Captain Westfall?\u201d",
        "\u201cThis king?\u201d Chaol nodded.",
        "Through the spots in her vision, she saw Chaol stop his horse.",
        "Chaol entered into the hallway once more, and bowed to the princess.",
        "Perhaps the guards who had taken Chaol to his chambers and given him a strong drink.",
        "Chaol hadn\u2019t shown up for breakfast, but rather sent her guards to bring her to the training hall\u00a0to practice on her own.",
        "\u201cLord Chaol Westfall.\u201d",
        "She still hadn\u2019t seen Chaol since yesterday.",
        "Chaol shook his head in disbelief.",
        "\u201cThis is what comes from such idle behavior,\u201d Chaol chuckled, stepping to the side so that Dorian stumbled forward.",
        "Chaol also didn\u2019t say anything when she moved closer to him for the remainder of their walk.",
        "Cain\u2019s eyes went wide as she buried the jagged end of the staff in\u00a0his right side, exactly where Chaol had said he would be unguarded.",
        "Sweat dripped from Chaol\u2019s brow.",
        "His feet heavy, Chaol followed after the prince, hoping Dorian wasn\u2019t about to drag them all into serious trouble.",
        "Chaol would be beyond furious if she infiltrated the ball, but she could handle it.",
        "\u2022\nBy that afternoon, a vicious rainstorm arrived, and Chaol permitted Celaena to walk around the castle with him after she\u2019d finished training with the other Champions for the day.",
        "Chaol\u2019s dark brows rose.",
        "Celaena made to join the forming line, but Chaol grasped her shoulder.",
        "Celaena shifted from one foot to the other, wishing she hadn\u2019t demanded that Chaol give her the aisle seat.",
        "Chaol tensed next to her, and she could feel him watching the thief closely, no doubt wondering if she and Nox were formulating some escape plan that would include the deaths of every member of the royal family.",
        "She\u2019d been willing to apologize to Chaol when he found her sparring with Nehemia that afternoon, but his behavior . . .",
        "There was beauty in Chaol\u2019s face\u2014and strength, and honor, and loyalty.",
        "Chaol remained beside her, saying nothing.",
        "Celaena felt her nostrils flare, and it was all Chaol could do to duck the apple she chucked at his head.",
        "\u201cChaol?\u201d he asked, falling into the trap.",
        "\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d Chaol asked.",
        "\u201cYou still haven\u2019t apologized,\u201d she said, changing the subject before Chaol could inquire further.",
        "Chaol cursed with impressive violence.",
        "She gave Chaol an apologetic look and turned her gaze to the altar.",
        "The next evening, Chaol Westfall stood on the second floor of the castle, looking over the courtyard.",
        "When the clock chimed three and most of the guests\u2014including the queen and Chaol\u2014had left, Celaena finally decided that it was safe for her to leave.",
        "\u201cThen I suppose you\u2019re just like Chaol.\u201d",
        "He bowed to Kaltain, then to Chaol.",
        "If she wanted to break free, she\u2019d have to go through Chaol first.",
        "She faced Chaol.",
        "Sure enough, there were more Champions seated at the tables\u2014even the pimply-faced Pelor sat near Chaol!",
        "Mask or no mask, Chaol would know it was her.",
        "She felt Dorian watching her\u2014and not in the cautious way that Chaol sometimes watched her.",
        "He wouldn\u2019t punish Chaol Westfall\u2014if only to avoid Dorian raising hell in the captain\u2019s defense.",
        "Chaol had only told him that she came from Terrasen, and that her family was dead.",
        "Chaol squeezed her hand, his skin warm in the frigid air.",
        "Chaol wasn\u2019t nearly as smart as he thought he was.",
        "Even still, Chaol had to push his way through a crowd of gathered guards and servants, Celaena keeping close behind him.",
        "Chaol halted and bowed low.",
        "It was bad enough they were walking together without Chaol, but to enter the kennels . . .",
        "Though after all he\u2019s done, I think he deserved Chaol running him through like that.\u201d",
        "\u201cIt was a dream,\u201d said Chaol.",
        "Chaol\u2019s eyes were hard upon them.",
        "Chaol coughed, suddenly very interested in the berries in the hedges.",
        "Chaol Westfall took a deep breath.",
        "With a shrug, Celaena handed the arrow to Chaol.",
        "Chaol snorted, but Dorian went on.",
        "\u201cChaol knew what he was doing.\u201d",
        "It was Chaol.",
        "Chaol chuckled at her agitation and pointed his sword at the rack, allowing her to get to her feet.",
        "He was fond of her, but Chaol didn\u2019t know if he could sleep at night knowing that he had retrained and released the world\u2019s greatest assassin.",
        "Given how easily Chaol had kept up with her, if Brullo had trained him, then the Weapons Master must live up to his title.",
        "Chaol put a hand on the hilt of his sword.",
        "\u201cOne more tower and the whole thing will collapse,\u201d the Crown Prince said from his spot on the other side of Chaol.",
        "Which it wouldn\u2019t, if Chaol was looking into it.",
        "Chaol said nothing as he began walking again.",
        "What about lessons with Chaol?",
        "Chaol always came for lunch, and afterward, she joined the other Champions for a few more hours of training under Brullo\u2019s watchful eye.",
        "Chaol took another step toward Nehemia\u2014effectively blocking Celaena\u2019s path to Kaltain.",
        "Celaena\u2019s legs had become so stiff that Chaol was forced to help her onto her horse.",
        "Celaena and Chaol rose and stepped aside.",
        "Celaena turned to Chaol.",
        "Not in this chamber, where no one would find her, where Chaol would never know why she disappeared, and would forever curse her for it, where she\u2019d never get the chance to tell Nehemia she had been wrong.",
        "Dorian growled as Chaol switched to the offensive, and conceded step after step, his thighs aching.",
        "\u201cThat\u2019s all you have to offer as an explanation for what you did?\u201d Captain Westfall demanded.",
        "Chaol sighed as he dismounted in the open courtyard.",
        "Chaol had warned him to watch his mouth when speaking to his father, but when he spoke to him like that, as if he were a pampered idiot . . .",
        "\u201cEnjoyed that, did you?\u201d Chaol growled.",
        "Dorian made a wide sweep of his sword, and Chaol took up the defensive.",
        "\u201cI intercepted Chaol, and he informed me of your \u2018condition.\u2019",
        "Celaena remained with Chaol.",
        "Please tell me this is Chaol\u2019s ring.",
        "I don\u2019t think Chaol would ever have given that order,\u201d he added, though he wasn\u2019t sure why.",
        "As she made to stand, she felt the thud of Cain\u2019s steps, and Chaol\u2019s eyes went wide.",
        "\u201cYou and Chaol really delight in ruining any fun I might have, don\u2019t you?",
        "She found her legs weak when Chaol put a hand on her back to motion her to rise.",
        "Nox put a hand on her shoulder, and out of the corner of her eye, she spied Chaol and Dorian watching them closely.",
        "\u201cDo you think it was just poor luck,\u201d she murmured to Chaol, \u201cthat I\u2019m the one going second?\u201d",
        "Chaol remained close beside her while a fire was kindled and food prepared from the boxes and sacks of supplies.",
        "It wasn\u2019t until they rounded a corner that Chaol let out a deep breath and removed his hand from her back.",
        "But for now . . . Now, she\u2019d make Chaol eat his words.",
        "He nudged Chaol with his elbow.",
        "Where was Chaol or Brullo?",
        "Chaol fought his own smile.",
        "Chaol\u2014and all the guards\u2014watched them with hands on their swords.",
        "\u201cDo you feel that?\u201d she asked Chaol, who slowly, maliciously grinned.",
        "\u201cCaptain Westfall won\u2019t be pleased.\u201d",
        "\u201cAnd certainly more dramatic,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "\u201cWhat is this?\u201d Dragged from the wall, she found herself facing Chaol.",
        "Chaol cleared his throat beside them, obviously tired of being excluded from the conversation, and Celaena grinned at him.",
        "Without Chaol to stand near, she lingered beside a pillar, watching the competitors file in, flanked by guards and their trainers.",
        "\u2022\n\u201cDon\u2019t you ever do anything other than read?\u201d said Chaol.",
        "But Chaol and his men moved so fast that the fleeing Champion didn\u2019t have time to touch the glass door before an arrow went clean through his throat.",
        "\u201cEndovier must have been terrible,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "\u201cYou have the skills,\u201d Chaol said, \u201cbut some of your moves are still undisciplined.\u201d",
        "And Chaol would be disgraced and relieved of his position.",
        "Chaol dropped her hand.",
        "While he might trust her enough to leave her alone with Dorian, knowing that she had access to an unguarded escape route was a test she wasn\u2019t ready to give Chaol.",
        "Chaol ran a hand through his short hair and opened the dining room door.",
        "If she hit him . . . If she hit him, if she got into a brawl right here and the guards had to pull them apart, Chaol might not let her see Nehemia again, let alone leave her rooms after lessons, or stay late to practice with Nox.",
        "A footstep sounded, and he found Chaol standing across the foyer.",
        "Celaena swallowed hard, and Chaol lowered his sword, taking a step back from them.",
        "But Chaol told her to stay in the middle, anyway.",
        "She and Chaol sat with five soldiers.",
        "Chaol chuckled.",
        "Chaol didn\u2019t know if it was because of Endovier, or just being an assassin; whatever the cause of that unyielding rage, she could never entirely leash herself.",
        "Chaol snorted, though a hint of a smile appeared on his lips.",
        "Chaol\u2019s eyes darkened.",
        "\u201cShall I summon Chaol to see what he thinks?\u201d",
        "\u201cHow\u2019s Chaol?\u201d she asked, tensing.",
        "He shrugged, though she knew better than to tell him who\u2019d really given it to her\u2014rather, she knew Chaol wouldn\u2019t want Dorian to know.",
        "And Chaol.",
        "She clanked her chains against her saddle and flicked her eyes to Chaol.",
        "\u201cAnd is he as handsome as his older brother?\u201d Celaena smirked as Chaol tensed.",
        "Captain Westfall\u2019s brows rose.",
        "Chaol pulled her to his side, keeping a firm grip on her cloak as the Crown Prince approached.",
        "Moving her arm made sparks dance before her eyes, but she extended it until her fingertips reached the line of chalk, and stayed there, not a quarter of an inch from Chaol, the thick white mark separating them.",
        "Chaol moved them out of line, giving her chain a fierce tug.",
        "His hands were covered in dirt, but before Celaena could better observe him, or his strange behavior, he nodded to Chaol and stalked away behind the tower.",
        "Dorian grimaced at the rage flickering in Chaol\u2019s eyes.",
        "\u201cChaol got there first when you arrived.",
        "\u2022\n\u201cWill you not even smile on Yulemas?\u201d she asked Chaol as they walked out of the castle and toward the glass temple at the center of the eastern garden.",
        "Through the wall of Champions, guards, and their weapons, Celaena beheld Chaol kneeling by the unconscious guard.",
        "\u201cYou asked Chaol to read this?\u201d",
        "Her face warmed as Captain Westfall spoke.",
        "\u201cDone?\u201d Chaol asked.",
        "Chaol watched the last breath issue from Cain\u2019s mouth, watched him die.",
        "\u201cCaptain Westfall!\u201d Philippa scolded.",
        "Two guards helped lift him up, but Chaol could only stare at his bloody hands as they helped him away.",
        "They spoke quickly\u2014angrily\u2014before Chaol came back to Celaena.",
        "Chaol grabbed him by the collar of his jacket, and Dorian might have punched his friend had Chaol not been so lightning fast.",
        "As Celaena and Chaol entered the giant sparring room in the morning, she glanced at her competitors and remembered she wasn\u2019t the only one who hadn\u2019t a clue what to expect.",
        "\u201cYes,\u201d said Chaol.",
        "Still, Chaol understood enough to bristle, and Celaena could hardly contain her glee.",
        "Dorian shuddered at the thought of what it must have been like to witness it\u2014and at the mess Chaol had to deal with, from the injured soldier to the sponsor who\u2019d lost his Champion to the dead man himself.",
        "Chaol gave them a moment to collect their breath before he said, \u201cYes?\u201d",
        "She just had to make it down the stairs, and find a way to convince Chaol to let her stay.",
        "Chaol would die.",
        "It was Chaol, fastening her bandaged wrists into shackles.",
        "She had lied, and Chaol knew it.",
        "Chaol pulled away from her so fast that she nearly stumbled back.",
        "Chaol\u2019s hand darted to his sword as the soldiers turned to her, some of them sneering.",
        "Dorian looked to Chaol, who failed in his attempt to not appear incredulous.",
        "Chaol\u2019s brows rose slightly.",
        "Chaol sighed.",
        "\u201cChaol,\u201d she said, grabbing his hand and whirling him to face her.",
        "Celaena stared only at Chaol with those starlit eyes, and her long, white fingers floated through the air to meet his.",
        "\u201cGet up,\u201d Chaol said again, louder.",
        "Chaol had probably had the room looked over before they arrived.",
        "Surprisingly, Chaol didn\u2019t reprimand her, either.",
        "\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Chaol Westfall snapped at her.",
        "Based on Chaol\u2019s orders?",
        "\u201cCaptain Westfall, how far do slaves make it from the mines when they try to escape?\u201d",
        "\u201cBest of luck,\u201d she said to Nox before she strode toward the curtain, Chaol following her.",
        "Why had Chaol left so soon?",
        "It\u2019d been quickly agreed that while it was foolish of Celaena to spar with the princess, Chaol\u2019s absence was inexcusable, even with the dead Champion to investigate.",
        "\u201cThen go ahead,\u201d Chaol said, pointing to a distant target along the far wall of the abandoned hallway.",
        "Chaol\u2019s eyes lost focus for a moment.",
        "Chaol strode beside her, a hand on the eagle-shaped pommel of his sword.",
        "Chaol pointed his blade at her heart.",
        "\u201cWhat kind of animal makes scratches like those?\u201d she asked Chaol, but didn\u2019t need to hear his reply to know that his guess was as good as hers.",
        "Chaol\u2019s eyes were unfocused.",
        "While Dorian had congratulated her for saving Nox, and while the thief had hugged and thanked her again and again, only Chaol had frowned when the Test was over.",
        "Chaol unhooked the chain from his saddle and gave it a firm yank, motioning for her to dismount.",
        "Thanks to Chaol pulling her aside, she\u2019d been in the back of the line\u2014not dead last, but three from the end.",
        "She glared at him over her shoulder before she strode into the bathing chamber, Chaol close behind.",
        "\u201cIf that is Her Highness\u2019s wish, then it will be granted,\u201d Chaol interrupted.",
        "\u201cWhat difference does it make?\u201d Chaol said quietly.",
        "\u201cCaptain Westfall!\u201d Kaltain said, and curtsied.",
        "Chaol covered his face with a hand and let out a long, long sigh.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong?\u201d Chaol pressed.",
        "She laughed when Chaol, irked at how Celaena stood in front of the mirror for five minutes, admiring herself, half-dragged her out of\u00a0the room.",
        "She sensed Captain Westfall\u2019s attention.",
        "\u201cAnyway,\u201d Chaol added, jerking his chin at Dorian, \u201cI think you have far more attractive suitors vying for your attention.",
        "It didn\u2019t make a difference if the books were about magic\u201d\u2014her voice quieted at the word, even though Chaol and the councilman couldn\u2019t understand them\u2014\u201cor history.",
        "Taking the time to spar with him when there was a fresh corpse in the castle was a sacrifice Dorian was surprised Chaol had been willing to make; Dorian knew how much his position meant to him.",
        "Instead, I stood there as Chaol knelt at the sidelines.",
        "On the side of the room, Dorian and Chaol watched with crossed arms.",
        "The following morning, Celaena walked beside Chaol, her eyes on the marble floor of the hallway.",
        "Cain studied her face as if he could read it, as if he could hear something Chaol couldn\u2019t.",
        "\u201cAny word from your father?\u201d Chaol asked in a voice that indicated he knew something was amiss.",
        "Celaena translated Chaol\u2019s question with ease.",
        "Chaol watched Dorian dip Celaena, watched the way her lips widened in a smile and her eyes burst with light as the Crown Prince said something.",
        "\u201cThe Lady Lillian\u2019s servants were attending the service when she dressed,\u201d said Chaol.",
        "There was no kindness in Chaol\u2019s face, and she clicked her tongue as she left, her fists aching to bash his teeth down his throat.",
        "But Chaol\u2019s face remained unreadable.",
        "Finally, Chaol stopped somewhere on the ground floor.",
        "Chaol stopped before rounding a corner.",
        "Since returning from his travels, the king hadn\u2019t seemed any different, and was just as gruff with Chaol as he\u2019d always been.",
        "Days passed without seeing Nehemia, and Celaena kept her mouth shut about the incident to Chaol or Dorian or anyone who visited her chambers.",
        "There was Chaol, sitting beside some old man, talking and\u2014\nLaughing?",
        "The world stopped when Chaol entered instead.",
        "Chaol kept close to her as she found an empty spot in the crowd and stopped.",
        "Chaol had never seen anyone struck that hard.",
        "\u2022\nChaol watched Perrington at his table in the dining hall.",
        "\u201cHollin will grow into his lineage,\u201d Chaol grumbled.",
        "Amidst her worrying, another Test passed without incident or embarrassment\u2014though she couldn\u2019t say the same for the soldier who\u2019d been sent home\u2014and she kept up her intense training with Chaol and the other Champions.",
        "Chaol practically shoved her from him as he approached the pair.",
        "From the way Chaol said \u201cused to\u201d with a tinge of sadness, she assumed much had been lost.",
        "\u201cAs a child, I wouldn\u2019t go near it,\u201d Chaol admitted.",
        "\u201cOr are you as deft at handling your sword as Captain Westfall?\u201d",
        "But someone had already arrived, and Dorian clenched his jaw tight enough for it to hurt as she smiled and bowed to Chaol.",
        "Celaena followed after her, unceremoniously stripping down to her underclothes and enjoying it far too much when Chaol\u2019s cheeks reddened before he turned away.",
        "The clock struck and Chaol\u2019s shoulders sagged.",
        "After Chaol gave Fleetfoot a friendly rub on the head, the dog trotted back beneath the table, circled twice, and curled up.",
        "Brullo hadn\u2019t given them any indication what they might be tested for, and Chaol was just as clueless.",
        "Chaol stopped before the unmarked door of their practice room, and whirled to face her.",
        "They followed the Crown Prince, who, like Chaol, was swathed in a red cape, pinned over the left breast with a brooch fashioned after the royal seal.",
        "Chaol stopped before a door and informed the six sentries posted outside to watch the women and the princess\u2019s guards.",
        "\u201cArobynn Hamel?\u201d Chaol asked, setting down his glass.",
        "Chaol gave her a sharp look.",
        "Chaol only scowled at her\u2014obviously, she hadn\u2019t been that inconspicuous\u2014but Dorian smiled.",
        "\u201cWhat do you know about this forest?\u201d Chaol quietly asked her.",
        "Her tone sharpened, and Chaol flicked his eyes toward them.",
        "\u201cWhy?\u201d Chaol had the sudden urge to strangle him.",
        "\u201cKeep your wits about you,\u201d Chaol said, still watching the duel.",
        "When she remained upright, Chaol shifted on his feet, and the prince glanced at his captain before lifting his chin a bit higher.",
        "She didn\u2019t notice when Captain Westfall led her away, nor did she\u00a0notice when they walked down hall after hall.",
        "Dorian started to move, but Chaol shook his head.",
        "\u201cIf I have to call myself a jewel thief again\u2014\u201d\nChaol raised his brows.",
        "And, as Chaol\u2019s face paled, Celaena realized with a jolt that perhaps the Champions\u2019 killer and Elena\u2019s mysterious evil force might be one and the same.",
        "Chaol gave her a weighing look, but slumped his shoulders.",
        "Chaol sighed through his nose.",
        "Before she\u2019d gotten into the bath, Chaol had removed her shackles.",
        "His gaze fell on Chaol, and the guards who stood near him.",
        "Chaol nudged her with an elbow, motioning for her to stand before the table.",
        "Celaena looked to Chaol.",
        "Though his features remained neutral, Chaol\u2019s shoulders shifted, and his chin rose a bit higher.",
        "She supposed it was a privilege that Chaol hadn\u2019t locked her up, too.",
        "Chaol glanced at her ring, and she hid her smile as a faint line of color crept into his cheeks.",
        "Chaol\u2019s eyes softened.",
        "Chaol leaned closer, and Celaena leaned to meet him as he whispered: \u201cYou sound like a raving lunatic.\u201d",
        "To Celaena\u2019s delight, Chaol blushed.",
        "\u201cHow\u2019s court?\u201d Chaol asked, breathing hard.",
        "\u2022\nChaol stood with Dorian in the shadows atop the mezzanine, staring down at the assassin as she punched at the dummy situated in the center of the floor.",
        "\u201cI\u2019d forgotten,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "Dorian nodded to Chaol.",
        "Chaol didn\u2019t reply, and only glanced at her before dismounting.",
        "Chaol looked around the cavernous hall; in fact, most of the Champions\u2019 sponsors went about as usual.",
        "Chaol shook his head.",
        "Not missing a step, Chaol did the same.",
        "\u2022\nThe waltz was driving and so loud she had difficulty hearing herself think as Chaol pulled her into a shadowy alcove.",
        "Her heart jumped into a gallop, and Chaol dissolved from her thoughts, like dew beneath the morning sun.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m not trained to fight in battles,\u201d Chaol replied through his teeth.",
        "Chaol tossed his cape on top of hers, his toned body flexing through the dark threads of his shirt.",
        "Chaol\u2019s face softened \u201cI\u2019m sorry they died like that.\u201d",
        "\u201cCaptain Westfall didn\u2019t train me this morning,\u201d she offered.",
        "\u201cI think it\u2019s useless arguing with her, Chaol,\u201d Celaena said, nudging the Captain of the Guard with her elbow.",
        "Suddenly, she was back at the duel, prostrate on the ground, Cain laughing behind her, but all she could see, all she could hear, was Chaol as he knelt and reached for her.",
        "He should stay away from Celaena\u2014Chaol had enough to worry about.",
        "She found Captain Westfall standing across the path, watching her with pursed lips.",
        "A courtier named Otho stepped beside Chaol.",
        "Naturally, it was from an intentional blow of Chaol\u2019s wooden staff.",
        "\u201cIf you attempt anything foolish,\u201d Chaol said quietly, \u201cthey\u2019ll be here.\u201d",
        "But Chaol took no notice of her as he stormed in, his jaw clenched.",
        "\u201cAre you ready?\u201d Chaol asked.",
        "Chaol watched the prince disappear, his red cape billowing behind him, and sighed.",
        "Chaol chuckled, and they strode outside to where the running contest awaited.\n\u2022\nHer lungs burned and her legs were leaden, but she kept running, kept her position in the middle of the pack of Champions.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think Chaol told you our plan before the meeting\u2014risky, on all of our parts.\u201d",
        "But Chaol was his Captain of the Guard.",
        "\u201cI thought I asked you to clean her,\u201d he said to Captain Westfall, who stepped forward.",
        "Celaena glanced over her shoulder at Chaol, who gave his prince an apologetic look.",
        "Chaol, surprisingly enough, didn\u2019t object.",
        "\u201cChaol told me he took you to see the body; I hope it wasn\u2019t too harrowing.\u201d",
        "No wonder Chaol had looked so disheveled this morning!",
        "Celaena frowned, but obeyed as he walked to her, Chaol stepping closer.",
        "Chaol couldn\u2019t stop staring at his blood-soaked hands.",
        "Chaol kept reading.",
        "Chaol shrugged.",
        "Chaol subtly cleared his throat.",
        "Chaol left her, and Celaena didn\u2019t wait to hear the door shut before closing herself in her bedroom.",
        "Blood erupted everywhere, showering Chaol\u2019s arms, his head, his clothes.",
        "\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Chaol began, but Celaena silenced him with a wave of her hand.",
        "She watched in the mirror as Chaol appeared in the doorway, panting.",
        "\u201cNox,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "\u201cAnd why is that?\u201d Chaol replied.",
        "Brullo, Chaol, and the other trainers\u2014along with three dozen armed guards\u2014followed them around the game park on horseback.",
        "She could feel Chaol\u2019s eyes on her, though, reminding her to keep in the middle.",
        "Chaol\u2019s brows narrowed slightly.",
        "Pulling her hand from Chaol\u2019s, Celaena straightened her spine as she stepped into the ring.",
        "Beside Celaena, Chaol stood with his shoulders thrown back.",
        "\u201cWhat have I done?\u201d Chaol asked him.",
        "The prince\u2019s brows rose, and he turned to Captain Westfall.",
        "\u201cBut you\u2019re going to outlast them,\u201d Chaol continued.",
        "\u201cPlease,\u201d said another courtier, \u201ctell me that Chaol doesn\u2019t suddenly have a wife.\u201d",
        "She kept close to Chaol, which wasn\u2019t a change from the ordinary.",
        "\u201cThey say that her father is as rich as a king,\u201d Chaol said.",
        "Celaena glanced between Chaol\u2019s sword and her friend\u2019s weapon.",
        "Celaena looked to Chaol, who nodded, taking the knives from her as they joined the twenty-three other competitors encircling the man.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d he said at last, stopping himself from wondering if he could actually risk it\u2014risk his father\u2019s and Chaol\u2019s wrath, and what might happen if he decided to damn the consequences.",
        "The thought of Chaol going up against hundreds of them\u2014against men built like Cain\u2014made her a little sick.",
        "Dorian glared at Chaol.",
        "If Chaol spent so much time warning him about the dangers of associating with Celaena, what was he doing here in the middle of the night?",
        "\u201cBut you were a woman in Endovier,\u201d Chaol said, his voice rough and quiet.",
        "\u201cShut up,\u201d Dorian snarled, and slammed his sword into Chaol\u2019s.",
        "Chaol jerked his chin toward the food.",
        "Chaol remained beside her, watching the Champions stride off.",
        "The crowd began chattering as Chaol led her from the stairs, and they disappeared into the throng.",
        "Captain Westfall.\u201d",
        "Chaol and Dorian pushed off from where they both leaned against the wall, coming closer to the ring.",
        "She felt Chaol\u2019s hand graze her arm.",
        "Chaol hissed, and Dorian almost cried out as Celaena attempted to stand, but collapsed.",
        "Captain Westfall will show you to your chambers.\u201d",
        "But it was better than studying the corpse of the Eye Eater, which Chaol had spent the past few days investigating.",
        "\u201cYou seemed rather friendly with Sardothien,\u201d Chaol said, his voice cold.",
        "She had two male guards with her, armed to the teeth with an assortment of curved Eyllwe daggers and swords, both of them studying Chaol and Celaena closely\u2014weighing the threat.",
        "The library was gloomy, and were it not for the sound of Chaol flipping pages, it would have been wholly silent.",
        "Several hours later, Chaol stared at the door to her dining room.",
        "Chaol deflected, feigned, then thrust so hard that Dorian stepped back.",
        "\u2022\nChaol paced through his room, his time with Celaena over until she\u2019d train with the other Champions that afternoon.",
        "Chaol rubbed his shoulder.",
        "\u201cI didn\u2019t know assassins liked to read,\u201d Chaol called.",
        "\u2022\nDorian swung his sword, grunting as Chaol easily deflected the blow and parried.",
        "\u201cChaol isn\u2019t with me,\u201d he said with a quick smile.",
        "She held out her hand out for Chaol to observe.",
        "Not surprisingly, it was Chaol.",
        "Insults would have risen to her lips if Chaol hadn\u2019t touched her shoulder, his chestnut eyes filled with some emotion she couldn\u2019t yet understand.",
        "\u201cAre you going to join me?\u201d she said, and Chaol stiffened, realizing his error.",
        "Chaol never said anything when she doubled over, hands on her knees, and vomited up her breakfast, nor did he comment on the fact that she could go farther and farther each day without stopping for breath.",
        "But her ears had pricked when he\u2019d introduced himself to her overseer as Chaol Westfall, Captain of the Royal Guard, and suddenly, the sky loomed, the mountains pushed from behind, and even the earth swelled toward her knees.",

        "A trickle of fear formed in the back of Dorian\u2019s mind.",
        "Fine, she wouldn\u2019t mind if Kaltain and Perrington met horrible deaths, but Dorian would be there.",
        "But if he could get her close to Dorian . . .",
        "\u201cBe careful what you say, Dorian.\u201d",
        "Dorian stopped suddenly and straightened.",
        "Dorian, while he still enjoyed swordplay, had grown to prefer books.",
        "Dorian glanced at the window, then back at his father, steeling his nerve once more.",
        "Dorian straightened, detecting nearby movement.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re beautiful,\u201d Dorian said before he could think.",
        "He should be down there, a foot behind, watching them, making sure she didn\u2019t seize Dorian and use him to escape.",
        "\u201cDo not doubt me, Dorian,\u201d his father challenged.",
        "Dorian picked one up and stroked its head.",
        "\u201cWhere?\u201d the captain asked, jangling Celaena\u2019s chain for Dorian to notice.",
        "But in that one sentence, Dorian made his mistake, and he knew\u00a0that his father had found his new weak spot: the overwhelming terror that Celaena would be ripped from him.",
        "She glanced up at Dorian.",
        "\u201cI\u2014Dorian, I\u2019m the King\u2019s Champion.\u201d",
        "Just then Dorian waltzed by, sweeping the brunette with him.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve had meetings and important things to read,\u201d Dorian said, panting.",
        "\u2022\nAfter hours of enjoying himself at the feast, Dorian entered Celaena\u2019s rooms, not sure what, exactly, he was doing in the chambers of an assassin at two in the morning.",
        "Dorian shifted on his feet.",
        "Dorian crossed his arms as Celaena scooped up the dog.",
        "Dorian\u2019s shoulders stiffened.",
        "I hoped you\u2019d still be awake,\u201d the Crown Prince said, and Celaena jumped from her seat to find Dorian approaching.",
        "\u201cThis is what comes from such idle behavior,\u201d Chaol chuckled, stepping to the side so that Dorian stumbled forward.",
        "Dorian observed her.",
        "If Kaltain wanted Dorian\u2019s hand, then she\u2019d need to be far, far cleverer.",
        "But his feet were leaden, and Dorian could do nothing except watch her.",
        "Celaena laughed at something Dorian said.",
        "His feet heavy, Chaol followed after the prince, hoping Dorian wasn\u2019t about to drag them all into serious trouble.",
        "Not particularly inclined to add hostage-taking to his repertoire of abilities, Dorian had spent hours arguing against it.",
        "But, as you probably know, I\u2019m Dorian Havilliard, Crown Prince of Adarlan, perhaps now Crown Prince of most of Erilea.\u201d",
        "Neither had Dorian, especially not after all his talk of using Nehemia as a hostage to get the Eyllwe rebels to cooperate.",
        "\u201cGood night, Dorian.\u201d",
        "How strange it was to hear Dorian, son of the man who had banished and outlawed all traces of magic, talking about powerful amulets.",
        "Dorian frowned.",
        "\u201cAnd what about you?\u201d Dorian demanded.",
        "\u201cI was speaking to my Champion,\u201d Dorian said with a roguish wink.",
        "\u201cDorian, you are the Crown Prince.",
        "I know it\u2019s not my place to pry,\u201d she went on, the duke growing redder and more furious by the moment, \u201cbut I heard it not an hour ago from Dorian himself that . . .\u201d",
        "Dorian straightened as the king continued.",
        "Then Celaena laughed, and Dorian kept staring at her.",
        "While it terrified him to see her down there, a hand\u2019s breadth from Dorian\u2019s unprotected throat, what terrified him even more was that he trusted her.",
        "Around and around their words circled, and Dorian stared at them blankly.",
        "\u201cBy the Wyrd!\u201d Dorian laughed.",
        "She felt Dorian watching her\u2014and not in the cautious way that Chaol sometimes watched her.",
        "He wouldn\u2019t punish Chaol Westfall\u2014if only to avoid Dorian raising hell in the captain\u2019s defense.",
        "\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d Dorian said.",
        "\u201cI bet it was just a drunken brawl,\u201d Dorian said, though he had been in plenty of brawls himself and had never known anyone to go about removing someone\u2019s innards.",
        "\u201cI had it made for her,\u201d Dorian said casually, picking at his nails.",
        "Dorian bared his teeth.",
        "\u201cWell,\u201d said Dorian.",
        "Maybe the headaches would stop once she was at Dorian\u2019s side.",
        "Dorian\u2019s blood thrummed in his veins.",
        "\u201cYou two looked like you were in the middle of . . . something,\u201d Dorian said cautiously.",
        "Chaol snorted, but Dorian went on.",
        "Of course, she hadn\u2019t been thinking of Dorian when she chose such a fine lavender gown to wear tonight, or when she made sure her hair was so carefully arranged, or that her white gloves were spotless.",
        "Not to mention the complications of being with Dorian while she served as his father\u2019s Champion.",
        "Dorian and the queen sat in the first pew, a row of guards immediately behind.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s Dorian, by the way.",
        "Dorian stepped a little closer to her.",
        "\u201cShe\u2019s not a monster,\u201d Dorian said.",
        "With heavy eyelids, Dorian Havilliard tried not to slouch as he sat upon his throne.",
        "Most of the court, Dorian included, wore masks of varying sizes, shapes, and colors\u2014some of simple design, others elaborate and animal-shaped.",
        "While he might be a Havilliard, he was . . .",
        "His father said nothing, and Dorian went on, his heart racing.",
        "\u201cHopefully you\u2019re right,\u201d Dorian replied.",
        "And she had her claws in Dorian\u2019s heart.",
        "Dorian\u2019s temper flared with dizzying speed.",
        "She stared down the hall, at the servants who bowed to Dorian.",
        "Even if she\u2019d gone to the ball for the wrong reasons, she had had some fun dancing with Dorian.",
        "\u201cThere!\u201d Dorian said.",
        "Dorian winced.",
        "Dorian growled as Chaol switched to the offensive, and conceded step after step, his thighs aching.",
        "Dorian made a wide sweep of his sword, and Chaol took up the defensive.",
        "\u201cDorian, I don\u2019t like her.\u201d",
        "Instead, he struck strongly enough that Dorian staggered back a step, fighting to keep his footing.",
        "Nox put a hand on her shoulder, and out of the corner of her eye, she spied Chaol and Dorian watching them closely.",
        "Then Dorian\u2019s gaze met hers, and Celaena\u2019s blood turned into shooting stars.",
        "Dorian loosened the top button on his vest.",
        "Her heart pounded, but she managed a coy smile as Dorian bowed to her, opened the door, and they went inside.",
        "Most affectionately,\nDorian Havilliard\nCelaena laughed again and took the books from the woman\u2019s arms, thanking her for her trouble.",
        "Dorian ripped it open, and his stomach twisted at the long line of names.",
        "Dorian approached, and smiled at the princess as he bowed.",
        "Celaena\u2019s white cloak made her easy to spot, and Dorian could always be noticed by the empty circle of space around him.",
        "Dorian tried not to flinch as his father studied him.",
        "Dorian stood beside his father and smiled at her.",
        "As the assassin laughed quietly to herself, head bowed to the ground, Dorian surveyed her body.",
        "Dorian\u2019s expression was full of\u2014something.",
        "Dorian watched her face turn redder and redder.",
        "While he might trust her enough to leave her alone with Dorian, knowing that she had access to an unguarded escape route was a test she wasn\u2019t ready to give Chaol.",
        "Dorian\u2019s Eyllwe was just competent enough that he understood the gist of it to be: \u201cHis Highness certainly knows how to keep women entertained.\u201d",
        "Dorian had to help her.",
        "Her eyes flickered, but Dorian wouldn\u2019t yield.",
        "Someone stepped beside Dorian, and from her intake of breath, he knew it was Nehemia.",
        "\u201cJealous, are we?\u201d Dorian teased.",
        "\u201cDorian, she took the poison out of me.",
        "He shrugged, though she knew better than to tell him who\u2019d really given it to her\u2014rather, she knew Chaol wouldn\u2019t want Dorian to know.",
        "But duchess wasn\u2019t enough\u2014not when Dorian was still unmarried.",
        "\u201cThat remains to be seen,\u201d Dorian said.",
        "Somehow, Dorian didn\u2019t think that was the case\u2014not when she had the three giant scars on her back to forever remind her of his father\u2019s brutality.",
        "Dorian had been given a list of appropriate brides?",
        "He didn\u2019t understand the rage that arose upon seeing Dorian standing in the doorway, didn\u2019t want to understand that sort of anger.",
        "Dorian grimaced at the rage flickering in Chaol\u2019s eyes.",
        "Dorian looked to the ground.",
        "Remembering who stood beside him, he glanced at Dorian, who was still staring, wide-eyed, at the stairs.",
        "\u201cDorian,\u201d she began, and he flicked her on the nose.",
        "Dorian steepled his fingers.",
        "\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Dorian said, motioning to her personal guard to join them.",
        "Chaol grabbed him by the collar of his jacket, and Dorian might have punched his friend had Chaol not been so lightning fast.",
        "Even Dorian raised his brows at his father, but the king refused to acknowledge his son\u2019s silent questioning.",
        "Dorian shuddered at the thought of what it must have been like to witness it\u2014and at the mess Chaol had to deal with, from the injured soldier to the sponsor who\u2019d lost his Champion to the dead man himself.",
        "\u201cSix hundred rooms, military and servant\u2019s quarters, three gardens, a game park, and stables on either side,\u201d said Dorian, staring at his home.",
        "To Dorian\u2019s surprise, he realized that he didn\u2019t care.",
        "She reached the bottom of the stairs, and Dorian took a step forward.",
        "\u201cShe shouldn\u2019t pose any threat or problem while she\u2019s here,\u201d Dorian said as calmly as he could.",
        "\u201cTo everyone in this castle,\u201d Dorian said, \u201cyour name is Lillian Gordaina.",
        "Dorian looked to Chaol, who failed in his attempt to not appear incredulous.",
        "Prince Dorian?\u201d",
        "\u2022\nDorian didn\u2019t realize he\u2019d been transfixed by her until she straightened and demanded, \u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d",
        "Dorian hadn\u2019t forgotten it, either.",
        "Dorian leaned forward and kissed her.",
        "Chapter 46\nThe forest was still and frozen around Dorian, and snow collapsed from the trees in large clumps as he passed by.",
        "\u201cHappy Yulemas, Dorian.\u201d",
        "Dorian knew better than to struggle as his friend dragged him through the foyer, and stopped in front of the door to the hall.",
        "Dorian bowed low.",
        "\u201cIt won\u2019t take long for Dorian to ask me for a private audience.\u201d",
        "Dorian smiled weakly.",
        "Dorian swallowed hard.",
        "Only for an instant did she glance at Dorian, whose sapphire eyes gleamed with what she could have sworn was sadness before he smiled at her.",
        "\u201cI know that I\u2019m sometimes aloof with you, and I know you complain about it to Dorian, but\u2014\u201d",
        "Where was Dorian?",
        "She shoved thoughts of the murders aside as they strode past a fountain and she caught Dorian giving her an admiring glance from the corner of his eye.",
        "Dorian bit his lip, but said nothing.",
        "And while Nehemia might be playing a game that she had no chance of winning, Dorian couldn\u2019t deny that he greatly admired the princess for daring to play in the first place.",
        "When she recovered the hood, she found Dorian staring at her throat.",
        "Mischief coiled and sprang within her, but Dorian answered.",
        "And if he ever found out that Perrington or his father had sanctioned it, or somehow played a hand in Kaltain drugging her . . . Dorian\u2019s hands clenched into fists at his sides.",
        "Four years of service was the bargain you set with my son, though I cannot imagine why he felt the need to bargain with you,\u201d he said with a deadly glare in Dorian\u2019s direction.",
        "Dorian shook his head.",
        "Dorian stuffed the list of names into the pocket of his vest.",
        "\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Dorian countered, trying to keep his voice quiet.",
        "\u201cWhat happened?\u201d Dorian asked.",
        "While Dorian had congratulated her for saving Nox, and while the thief had hugged and thanked her again and again, only Chaol had frowned when the Test was over.",
        "Dorian let out a long breath, calming his panting.",
        "The captain stalked over to Dorian and grabbed him by the arm.",
        "\u201cWhy would Dorian be here?\u201d",
        "Dorian was on his own.",
        "The rush of having Dorian look only at her, talk only to her, treat her as if she were his equal and more hadn\u2019t yet worn off.",
        "And if the duke hated her as much as it seemed, she might have powerful allies when the time came to make sure Lillian released her hold on Dorian.",
        "Why wasn\u2019t she holding Dorian, comforting him?",
        "\u201cAnyway,\u201d Chaol added, jerking his chin at Dorian, \u201cI think you have far more attractive suitors vying for your attention.",
        "Dorian\u2019s attention flicked to her two guards, who lurked in the shadows nearby\u2014waiting, watching.",
        "\u2022\nKaltain watched in despair and bewilderment as Dorian carried the weeping assassin in his arms.",
        "Taking the time to spar with him when there was a fresh corpse in the castle was a sacrifice Dorian was surprised Chaol had been willing to make; Dorian knew how much his position meant to him.",
        "On the side of the room, Dorian and Chaol watched with crossed arms.",
        "She looked over her shoulder, giving Dorian a sneer as she led the princess deeper into the garden.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re trembling,\u201d Dorian said.",
        "Dorian watched him go.",
        "Chaol watched Dorian dip Celaena, watched the way her lips widened in a smile and her eyes burst with light as the Crown Prince said something.",
        "Dorian opened his mouth to reply, but the bag of candy tipped over and spilled across the table.",
        "She glanced at the king, who was still speaking with Perrington, and found Dorian watching her instead.",
        "The king smiled when Dorian didn\u2019t reply.",
        "\u201cThe king had it built around Dorian\u2019s birth.\u201d",
        "\u201cOnly a few years,\u201d Dorian said with a sigh.",
        "\u201cIf we\u2019re finished, I\u2019m afraid I must take my leave,\u201d interrupted Dorian from beside her, and her head snapped up at the sound of his voice\u2014and his impertinence in interrupting his father.",
        "But Dorian, tall, toned, and elegant, bore no resemblance to him.",
        "She\u2019d sent him a message saying she was going to train for a few hours after dinner, and he\u2019d invited Dorian to come along to watch.",
        "And is this for my sake or Dorian\u2019s?\u201d",
        "Days passed without seeing Nehemia, and Celaena kept her mouth shut about the incident to Chaol or Dorian or anyone who visited her chambers.",
        "Rubbing his neck, his face still burning, he walked from her rooms, wondering how, exactly, he\u2019d explain this to Dorian tomorrow.",
        "Dorian gave them a terse nod as he strode by.",
        "You will obey me, Dorian Havilliard, or you will pay.",
        "To his relief, the princess nodded and handed her staff to\u00a0one of her guards, then took the practice sword Dorian extended to her.",
        "\u201cIs everything all right?\u201d Dorian\u2019s voice sounded from the doorway.",
        "Nehemia laughed, and Dorian\u2019s face warmed.",
        "Dorian watched a grin spread across the assassin\u2019s face as she beheld the source.",
        "Dorian was many things, but he wasn\u2019t stupid; had he realized the symbolism in Nehemia\u2019s offer?",
        "She began sniffing about, though she stayed far from Dorian, and she soon disappeared beneath the bed.",
        "Dorian drowned in the cold rage that lay inside of him.",
        "Dorian winked.",
        "Dorian convinced the Captain of the Guard to take me as his apprentice, with the help of Brullo.",
        "Silence fell, and Dorian tried not to fidget as his father studied him.",
        "But someone had already arrived, and Dorian clenched his jaw tight enough for it to hurt as she smiled and bowed to Chaol.",
        "Dorian felt the eyes of the council upon them, weighing and considering every word out of her mouth, every move or reaction of his.",
        "Dorian eyed the assassin\u2019s dress again.",
        "Dorian spun Celaena with speed and dexterity, and she snapped into his arms, her shoulders rising with exhilaration.",
        "He led her from the center of the room, where they took up a spot beside Dorian Havilliard.",
        "Celaena opened an eye and frowned as Dorian sat on her bed.",
        "\u201cHe\u2019s a Havilliard.\u201d",
        "He was fairly certain she was a virgin, but did Dorian know it?",
        "I might not have as much time to read as you and Dorian do, but that doesn\u2019t mean I love books any less.\u201d",
        "Dorian pushed off the wall.",
        "Chaol only scowled at her\u2014obviously, she hadn\u2019t been that inconspicuous\u2014but Dorian smiled.",
        "Dorian was slumped in an armchair, resting his head on a hand.",
        "\u201cWell, Prince Dorian told me something.\u201d",
        "\u2022\n\u201cFor the world\u2019s greatest assassin, this is pathetic,\u201d said Dorian, stepping from the doorway.",
        "Dorian\u2019s breath was warm on her head, and she smiled as he brought his arm around her, cupping her shoulder.",
        "Dorian turned around a hedge, almost crashing into a figure of blue-green velvet.",
        "Dorian started to move, but Chaol shook his head.",
        "Dorian snatched the book from her hands.",
        "How far would she go to secure her position at Dorian\u2019s side?",
        "\u201cOf course you don\u2019t, Dorian.",
        "\u2022\nDorian walked slowly back to his rooms, his heart racing.",
        "\u201cWhat to do now?\u201d Dorian said.",
        "He had no idea what she\u2019d do once Sardothien was out of the way\u2014once Dorian was free again.",
        "\u201cI would sooner cut out my own heart than love a Havilliard,\u201d she snarled.",
        "\u201cCome see the view,\u201d Dorian clarified.",
        "His father was upon him before Dorian could brace himself.",
        "She saw Dorian\u2019s face and the crown that sat upon his head.",
        "\u201cAre you going to the feast tonight?\u201d Dorian asked the princess, forcing himself to look at her and keep his features neutral.",
        "\u2022\nChaol stood with Dorian in the shadows atop the mezzanine, staring down at the assassin as she punched at the dummy situated in the center of the floor.",
        "But there was a man somewhere in Dorian\u2014a man who could be honed into a warrior.",
        "Dorian nodded to Chaol.",
        "Never, not in her most fanciful dreams, had she imagined that the opportunity to speak with Dorian Havilliard would arise.",
        "Dorian threw his hands in the air.",
        "Dorian found it difficult to breathe.",
        "A dull head wouldn\u2019t stop it from going through Perrington\u2019s throat\u2014or Dorian\u2019s, if she wanted.",
        "Maybe Dorian.",
        "Dorian took Celaena\u2019s hand.",
        "Perhaps Dorian would now see why she was such a threat to him.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s nothing to be upset about,\u201d Dorian said.",
        "Kaltain shook her head, but looked at Dorian as she spoke.",
        "Dorian put his hands in his pockets as he strode down the halls of the castle.",
        "Dorian, I\u2019m your father\u2019s minion.",
        "Dorian had found her just moments after dinner and invited her for a walk.",
        "Rather, Dorian just seemed to be watching her because he enjoyed watching her.",
        "And whether he admitted it or not, Dorian had his own obligations to fulfill.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s not sick,\u201d Dorian said.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m sure the princess has her reasons,\u201d Dorian said warily, disgusted by his mother\u2019s unspoken prejudice.",
        "After hours of kissing and talking and more kissing on her bed, Dorian had left only minutes before.",
        "\u201cShe made another friend?\u201d Dorian said, raising his brows as Celaena demonstrated a move for Nox.",
        "\u201cThank you,\u201d she said to Dorian.",
        "\u201cI want to know what you\u2019re going to do with the assassin,\u201d he said, and his father smiled in a way that made Dorian\u2019s blood run cold.",
        "Dorian crossed his arms, swallowing his repulsion.",
        "Dorian Havilliard smiled at her as Nehemia took a seat.",
        "Dorian\u2019s sapphire gaze darkened.",
        "Dorian\u2019s face colored, but he did not drop his father\u2019s stare.",
        "\u201cNo, I don\u2019t,\u201d whispered Dorian, and walked away.",
        "Princess Nehemia lunged, slapping Dorian on the wrist with her sword.",
        "\u201cIf it won\u2019t respond to humans, then it will have to be killed,\u201d Dorian said offhandedly, and a spark went through Celaena.",
        "To Dorian\u2019s dismay, his face became warm.",
        "But it was not Dorian Havilliard who entered, nor was it a ferocious creature.",
        "And after that show of will and power in his throne room . . . Dorian could be a strong general, if he was pushed.",
        "The back of the king\u2019s hand connected with Dorian\u2019s cheek, and the prince staggered, but regained his countenance.",
        "Dorian looked around.",

        "But then Cain\u2014bearing the shadowy, dark thing that dwelled inside of him\u2014stepped through the wall as if it were nothing, shattering it completely.",
        "But Cain kept staring at her, his smile growing.",
        "Because aside from her, Cain\u2019s favorite Champion to torment was Pelor.",
        "It wouldn\u2019t stop until his father said something or Cain knocked her truly unconscious.",
        "\u201cCain thinks he can, but I don\u2019t like taking risks.\u201d",
        "Nox, standing beside her, hissed as Cain shoved into Grave and sent him staggering back.",
        "Whatever wound Cain was touching, it burned.",
        "\u201cYour mother was a pretty young thing, wasn\u2019t she?\u201d Cain said.",
        "She could think of no nicer Yulemas gift than for Cain to be found dead the next morning.",
        "Elena was on her feet in an instant, blocking Cain\u2019s path to Celaena.",
        "Chaol watched the last breath issue from Cain\u2019s mouth, watched him die.",
        "\u201cBut . . . but in that . . . place\u2014Cain didn\u2019t look like Cain.",
        "She kicked and punched at nothing as Cain squatted over her and hit her in the mouth.",
        "Cain circled her, swinging his sword idly.",
        "Cain entered the hall, flanked by two guards and a scarred, burly man who must have been his trainer.",
        "Not that it would be, as Cain was little more than a pawn in a game to amuse the king, and certainly not a member of the royal guard.",
        "Even Cain didn\u2019t breathe too deeply.",
        "So he watched, in growing horror and despair, as Cain\u2019s fist slammed into her jaw.",
        "Cain could open it long enough for the ridderak to come through, but then it would shut.",
        "\u201cCain knows, too.",
        "Cain looked to the king as he retrieved his sword.",
        "She had to focus on Cain, on wearing him down.",
        "\u201cShe wanted to use me to get to your son, but I don\u2019t want the power to turn her into Cain.",
        "She could defeat Grave and Cain with this.",
        "\u201cPity,\u201d Cain whispered from the doorway, pocketing her knife.",
        "She wanted to tell him about Cain.",
        "And then, stepping toward Cain on knees that bent the wrong way\u2014like an animal\u2019s hind legs\u2014the ridderak emerged.",
        "\u201cDo you think she stands a chance against Cain?\u201d",
        "But a makeshift knife, a heavy book, and a candlestick weren\u2019t protection against what Cain could summon.",
        "How had Cain learned to summon that creature\u2014and what was that blackness from whence it had appeared?",
        "If Cain had been standing beside her, she might have snapped his neck just to end it there.",
        "But, locked in that dark, horrible world, Celaena only saw the ancient queen barrel into Cain, knocking him down, before the dead charged.",
        "All, of course, except Cain.",
        "But she\u2019d get little sleep tonight\u2014or until Cain was impaled on the end of her sword.",
        "She hadn\u2019t told him about Cain revealing that he knew who she really was, or the possible murder connection to the Wyrdmarks\u2014not yet.",
        "Chapter 29\nAt their Test the next afternoon, Celaena stood in the training hall with her arms crossed, watching Cain spar with Grave.",
        "Cain knew that she\u2019d discovered how he was eliminating the competition.",
        "Celaena shot Nehemia a look, but the princess\u2019s eyes remained upon Cain\u2014narrowed, but her lips strangely slack.",
        "I hate all these guards and nonsense; I hate you telling me to hold back when Brullo sings Cain\u2019s praises and I\u2019m just there, boring and unnoticed in the middle.",
        "Celaena could only gape as the flag was ripped down, and Cain howled his triumph.",
        "Did he know that Cain had the ability to open portals, real portals, to other worlds?",
        "She could kill anyone, Cain included, in a matter of seconds.",
        "Cain began laughing, and she felt the reverberations of his steps as he walked around the ring.",
        "Cain sprawled upon the ground.",
        "Cain had cracked one of her ribs, and it ached every time she breathed.",
        "The other competitors shuffled along, following Cain\u2019s path.",
        "\u201cOne minute, you were walloping Grave, and the next, Cain was beating the living daylights out of you\u2014\u201d",
        "It was clear Cain and Celaena would ultimately face each other, and until then . . . well, the other Champions weren\u2019t worth his time.",
        "But there was also something abnormal about the way Cain just stood there, smiling.",
        "Renault was retreating, each swing of Cain\u2019s blade taking him closer and closer to the line of chalk that had been drawn on the ground.",
        "\u201cI should have sliced Cain open the moment he laid a hand on you.",
        "\u201cThank you for killing Cain.\u201d",
        "Let them all watch Cain, let them plot against him.",
        "Cain smiled throughout the entire thing, barely panting.",
        "Because, she\u2019d realized last night, if she told him about Cain and the creature he\u2019d unleashed, then he\u2019d ask to see the remains of the creature.",
        "But then Cain stepped up to the white line painted at the back of the room, drew back his yew bow, his black ring glinting, and fired.",
        "And, of course, she kept her head down throughout it all, doing enough to keep Brullo from critiquing her, but not enough to make him praise her the way he did Cain.",
        "Cain grabbed the collar of her jacket to pull her to her feet.",
        "Cain fell, hitting the ground hard.",
        "\u201cCain can\u2019t kill her on his own?",
        "Cain was so large\u2014he was a mountain, and his blows . . . they made Chaol seem like a child . . .",
        "Normally, Verin could be found near Cain, taunting the other Champions.",
        "So Celaena smiled and rolled her shoulders as she said brightly: \u201cShove it up your ass, Cain.\u201d",
        "\u201cI expected better,\u201d Cain said as Celaena crawled into a kneeling position, still clutching at her useless piece of wood.",
        "She would duel against Grave, Renault, and Cain tomorrow.",
        "A gust of wind slammed into Cain so hard he was sent sprawling to the ground, his sword flying across the veranda.",
        "Ahead, Cain turned a corner, heading north\u2014back toward the castle.",
        "They\u2019d each been given the opportunity to select one object to aid them in their ascent\u2014rope, spikes, special boots\u2014and sure enough, Cain had gone right for the rope.",
        "Cain studied her face as if he could read it, as if he could hear something Chaol couldn\u2019t.",
        "Cain growled as he swung his sword, making to behead her.",
        "Cain raised his head and stood slowly as the creature knelt before him and lowered its dark eyes.",
        "Perhaps she should have sent word to him about Cain\u2019s strange behavior earlier that afternoon.",
        "But Cain didn\u2019t smile at her, not in that mocking way.",
        "Kaltain took the goblet when she finished, and curtsied to Cain as she accepted his and slunk away.",
        "Going back down there wasn\u2019t an option\u2014not while Cain lived.",
        "While Cain is a brute, he\u2019s Duke Perrington\u2019s Champion.\u201d",
        "\u201cNot even with Cain, but when you\u2014\u201d",
        "The king had barely said anything to him over the past week, and Cain\u2019s name hadn\u2019t been mentioned in any of their meetings.",
        "Celaena, unsure how she\u2019d ever sleep again now that she knew what Cain could do, had been grateful for the company.",
        "Cain just had to jump and swing\u2014amateur scaling.",
        "When he finished, his eyes gleaming with resentment, the Champions sniggered, and Cain laughed the loudest.",
        "\u201cCain,\u201d she said, but he took off down the hall like a jackrabbit, faster than he should have any ability to run.",
        "But here, it was hard to focus when Cain was nearby, taunting and sneering, waiting for her to make one mistake.",
        "Cain and Verin laughed, but she and Nehemia walked away, the princess holding her hand tightly.",
        "She didn\u2019t spy Nox, or the other remaining Champions\u2014or Cain.",
        "Cain moved so quickly that she could only blink before he was behind her, her knife somehow now in his hand.",
        "Her head whacked against the black stone, and he bit down on his yell, forcing himself to remain on the sidelines, forcing himself to watch as Cain broke her apart, piece by piece.",
        "After his father had allowed Cain to toy with and hurt Celaena for so long, when she\u2019d clearly been drugged . . .",
        "\u2022\nCelaena tasted blood as Cain seized her again, dragging her across the floor.",
        "Nox glanced again at Cain.",
        "He jerked his chin toward Cain, who was in the middle of examining his bulging biceps.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t stop Cain the moment I knew something was wrong.",
        "Celaena Sardothien was his best and only choice now that Cain was dead.",
        "And Cain told me.\u201d",
        "She shoved Cain out of her head.",
        "The greenish light still seeped from the marks on the floor\u2014marks Cain had etched with his own blood\u2014illuminating the creature who stared at her with those starving, relentless eyes.",
        "She squared her shoulders as Cain halted.",
        "What if Cain could summon anything to him\u2014like the dead?",
        "Cain or Grave, most likely.",
        "Renault, refusing to take up the defensive, swept forward again, landing a few strong blows on Cain\u2019s blade.",
        "More cheers rose up to meet them as Cain waved the flag for everyone to see.",
        "\u201cCain,\u201d was all she could say.",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s that on your face?\u201d Cain asked.",
        "The tightness in her chest abated only slightly when she couldn\u2019t find Cain\u2019s face among the revelers.",
        "Verin gave her a snakelike smile, and Cain clapped him on the back as he entered the chalk-etched circle, drawing his sword.",
        "\u201cCain and Councilman Garnel\u2019s Champion will go first.",
        "Whatever Nehemia\u2019s involvement was, it wasn\u2019t with Cain.",
        "Cain would definitely be there, but who would the other final three be?",
        "Cain, panting and grinning, approached.",
        "It came crashing down upon her, and Celaena dropped the bloody remnant of the staff on the ground as she removed her foot from Cain\u2019s back.",
        "She had a feeling the nightmares were due to its absence, and wished repeatedly for it to be restored to her, even though Cain was now dead.",
        "\u201cCain summoned all of those things at the duel, didn\u2019t he?\u201d",
        "But Cain wasn\u2019t done, and his attention shifted to Nehemia.",
        "Cain knew who she was; all of her simpering and pretending and holding back had been for nothing.",
        "He dropped to his knees beside Cain, but didn\u2019t touch him.",
        "Now I\u2019ll just defeat Cain in the duel, and then no one needs to know.",
        "The world spun black and mist and blue as Cain grabbed her and shoved her against the clock tower once more, her face smashing into the stone.",
        "Cain edged closer, his broadsword gleaming.",
        "\u201cWhy not right now?\u201d Cain breathed.",
        "In doing so, he missed the look exchanged between Cain and his father.",
        "\u201cCain,\u201d she whispered, backing into the door as she fumbled with the handle.",
        "Blood poured onto her hands as she yanked it out, and Cain staggered back, clutching his ribs.",
        "And while she\u2019d be more than happy if some dark force somehow destroyed Cain, Perrington, the king, and Kaltain Rompier, if Nehemia, or even Chaol and Dorian, were somehow harmed . . .",
        "Cain\u2019s access to the Otherworlds, to the In-Between, to whatever all that nonsense was, had given him the ability to see into her mind, her memories, her soul.",
        "Cain, his features set with fury, stood not too far behind, blood seeping through his fingers as he clutched his side.",
        "There were certain things she\u2019d never tell anyone, and she hadn\u2019t mentioned Cain or the creature, either.",
        "She would not lose to Cain, or Renault, or any of them.",
        "Cain teased her\u2014breaking not only her body, but her will . . .",
        "Nehemia looked after Cain, and her dark eyes narrowed.",
        "Cain\u2019s eyes would open no more because of him . . .",
        "Whatever had happened with Cain, whatever had happened at the duel . . . that would haunt him.",
        "Or stop Cain.",
        "What\u2019d you make of Cain?\u201d",
        "Brullo, however, either didn\u2019t know or didn\u2019t care, and didn\u2019t even give a nod before he pointed to the man to Cain\u2019s right.",
        "She didn\u2019t remember much of what had happened after the duel yesterday, but at least she wasn\u2019t dead\u2014either by Cain or the king\u2019s order.",
        "There were only six of them left now: Cain, Grave, Nox, a soldier, and Renault, a vicious mercenary who\u2019d stepped up to replace Verin as Cain\u2019s right-hand man.",
        "Cain let out a breathy laugh.",
        "She broke her stare with Cain and glared up into Chaol\u2019s face.",
        "\u201cLook out, Cain,\u201d Verin said from beside her.",
        "If we were merely to give her a dose of bloodbane, not lethal, but just enough to cause her to lose control, it would give Cain the advantage he needs.\u201d",
        "She glanced over her shoulder at Cain, who was joking with Grave as if he weren\u2019t a demon-summoning psychopath.",
        "Cain bowed and didn\u2019t offer Renault a hand to help him rise before he stalked toward the opposite end of the veranda.",
        "When it was over and Cain\u2019s eyes stopped seeing him, Chaol\u2019s sword clattered to the ground.",
        "\u201cYou might think this . . . girl can win, but you forget that Duke Perrington is sponsoring Cain.",
        "No, she\u2019d said that just to keep talking, to keep him here as long as he would be willing to stay, so she didn\u2019t have to face a night alone with the threat of Cain hovering over her.",
        "And why had Cain been cleaning it?",
        "\u2022\nSomething in Chaol began fraying as Celaena raised her bloodied face to look at Cain.",
        "How did Cain know these things about Celaena\u2019s past?",
        "The shadowy figure that was Cain raised his arm, dropping the amulet upon the ground.",
        "\u201cLots of barking from the prince\u2019s lapdog,\u201d Cain said.",
        "There were a few more shouts, and she looked down long enough to see that Grave was causing a backup because he couldn\u2019t manage to toss his rope around the gargoyle\u2019s neck as Cain had.",
        "\u201cBetter than Cain\u2019s time.\u201d",
        "Cain chuckled as he stepped toward the panting assassin and raised his sword, aiming at the assassin\u2019s chest.",
        "I should have been the one to kill Cain.\u201d",
        "\u201cRip Cain\u2019s head off,\u201d he whispered with a wicked grin.",
        "She tensed as Cain came to stand nearby, half-hidden in the shadow of the clock tower behind them.",
        "It was not a showcase of her abilities, especially if that book had been right and Cain had been granted the strength of all those dead Champions.",
        "Cain grunted and pressed Renault\u2019s blade, forcing the mercenary to take a step back.",
        "Cain cleared the trees and raised his arms above his head in victory.",
        "She\u2019d seen him square off against Cain before; he\u2019d never won, but he always managed to hold out longer than she would have thought possible.",
        "And those things Cain had said.",
        "In fact, every time she saw him, Cain seemed bigger and bigger.",
        "Light flashed as she was yanked back, and her eyes bulged as Cain threw her to the ground near the edge of the ring.",
        "Suddenly, she was back at the duel, prostrate on the ground, Cain laughing behind her, but all she could see, all she could hear, was Chaol as he knelt and reached for her.",
        "Cain returned her smile and stalked off.",
        "\u201cI heard him talking to Cain,\u201d said a timid voice behind them, and they found Pelor, the youngest assassin, standing nearby.",
        "Chapter 42\nCain.",
        "She\u2019d shut Cain up\u2014in an unmarked grave for all eternity.",
        "At the sound of their footsteps, Cain\u2019s head shot up.",
        "\u201cCain sometimes forgets to guard his right side.",
        "She would have won if she\u2019d taken the easy route\u2014she would have gotten there in half the time it took Cain.",
        "She gave one to Cain, then walked over to Celaena and handed the other to her before pausing in front of the king\u2019s table.",
        "\u201cPetty tricks, Your Majesty,\u201d Cain said to Elena.",
        "Cain\u2019s eyes went wide as she buried the jagged end of the staff in\u00a0his right side, exactly where Chaol had said he would be unguarded.",
        "\u201cCain.\u201d",
        "Cain must have learned about the Wyrdmarks in the White Fang Mountains\u2014that cursed borderland between Adarlan and the Western Wastes.",
        "\u201cWhy?\u201d He shot a look at Cain.",
        "Cain\u2019s insufferable grin returned.",
        "You\u2019ll still beat Cain in the duels.\u201d",
        "\u201cAll I know is that Cain knew the secrets of my people\u2019s power\u2014power that has long been forgotten in the lands of the North.",
        "\u201cCain proved the physical transformative effects, and Kaltain proves the ability to influence thoughts and emotions.",
        "And Cain, to her delight, wound up going purple in the face after consuming belladonna.",
        "Cain whirled to look at her, and the ridderak\u2019s head shot up, its slitted nostrils sniffing twice.",
        "Had he already told Cain what was beyond the curtain?",
        "She leapt back a step and sliced open Cain\u2019s arm with the broken end of the staff, ripping through muscle and sinew.",
        "She and Nehemia took up behind him, and as they crossed the small patio in which the clock tower stood, Celaena looked at the spot where Cain had just been kneeling.",
        "Cain howled as it bit into him, the light slashing his shadow-body into ribbons.",
        "She kept her distance when Cain lumbered toward the water jug on the table by the far wall, watching his every movement.",
        "A large ring of black, iridescent stone glimmered on Cain\u2019s finger\u2014strange that he\u2019d wear it to practice.",
        "But Cain lifted his sword.",
        "Cain\u2019s black eyes gleamed.",
        "Celaena drew another dagger, but paused as Verin called to her from the ring where he sparred with Cain.",
        "\u201cExcellent, Cain,\u201d Brullo said, clapping.",
        "Tomorrow\u2014or was it today already?\u2014she\u2019d face Cain.",
        "Enough of Cain.",
        "\u201cMilady,\u201d Cain said, bowing his head as he strode by.",
        "\u201cCain knows who I am,\u201d she said quietly, lowering her bow.",
        "Cain stalked to where Celaena panted, her face white and red.",
        "Every day, she got better at running, going farther and faster, and managed to keep from killing Cain when he taunted her at training.",
        "Cain was close, not a trace of shadow around him.",
        "Cain went still, and for a moment, she could have sworn his eyes glowed like coals.",
        "Cain came at her, and she had no choice but to meet his blows, barely having the strength to raise the weapon each time.",
        "\u201cBecause Cain hated you, of course.",
        "She glanced skyward, seeing the tip of Cain\u2019s chin before he hoisted her onto her feet and slammed her\u2014face-first\u2014into a wall of freezing, smooth stone.",
        "She strode away, past the grinning Nox, and stopped before Cain.",
        "\u201cCain!\u201d she shouted, and banged on the door with a fist, hard enough to hurt.",
        "The thought of Chaol going up against hundreds of them\u2014against men built like Cain\u2014made her a little sick.",
        "She steadied herself, wielding the staff like a sword as Cain began circling.",
        "He couldn\u2019t watch as Cain kicked her shoulder, and felt as if he\u2019d vomit when the brute picked her up and she fell to the ground.",
        "How had she beaten Cain, when she\u2019d been drugged?",
        "Cain swung his sword at Celaena, who threw herself backward\u2014but not fast enough.",
        "And use it to burn Cain alive.",
        "\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s recovered well from killing Cain,\u201d Dorian said.",
        "\u201cYou found and defeated the evil Cain was bringing into the world.",
        "Of course, the king would know Cain\u2019s name.",
        "She squared her shoulders as Cain strode straight toward her, his thick lips parting in a grin.",
        "And inside the small chamber, kneeling before a darkness so black that it seemed poised to devour the world, was Cain.",
        "Unfortunately, Cain didn\u2019t bother to hide his triumphant grin.",
        "Cain had incapacitated Verin while he summoned the creature; it liked its blood hot.",
        "Cain was leaning against the clock tower.",
        "Before she could recover, Cain yanked his sword from her weapon and surged toward her.",
        "Cain lifted his sword and ran his finger through the blood\u2014her blood.",
        "Cain laughed, and she almost screamed in anger.",
        "Cain and Renault bowed to the king, then to each other, and drew their swords.",

        "Cain drew his sword, a crooked grin on his face as he crouched in a defensive stance in the center of the ring.",
        "All she could think about was Cain\u2014Cain getting applauded by Perrington, Cain getting clapped on the back by Brullo, Cain getting all of that praise and attention, not because he was a mountain of muscle, but because he actually deserved it.",
        "She couldn\u2019t see the little dot in its center\u2014the dot that no one had yet to touch, even Cain.",
        "He pointed a stubby finger at Cain.",
        "He smirked as he watched Cain, who was stretching out his muscular arms.",
        "Nox would leave you for Cain.\u201d",
        "Cain\u2019s attention was on Celaena as he said, \u201cYou were brought here\u2014all of you were.",
        "To his credit, Grave held up well against Cain, even though she saw how his knees trembled from the effort.",
        "In a flash of steel, Cain had his blade at Grave\u2019s throat, and the pockmarked assassin bared his rotting teeth at him.",
        "\u201cGood,\u201d Cain panted, pressing her staff so hard that his blade sank into the wood.",

        "And, of course, she kept her head down throughout it all, doing enough to keep Brullo from critiquing her, but not enough to make him praise her the way he did Cain.",

        "And Nehemia never spoke with that kind of flawless accent, and\u2014\nIn the shadows behind the desk, a piece of paper had fallen between the wood and the stone wall.",
        "After cutting short their lesson in favor of a stroll, Celaena and Nehemia walked through the spacious halls of the castle, guards trailing behind them.",
        "Nehemia still sat with the queen, wearing a gold-and-turquoise mask with a lotus motif.",
        "\u201cIf you consider this structure of madness to be a castle,\u201d Nehemia replied.",
        "But Nehemia just clicked her tongue.",
        "\u201cNonsense,\u201d Nehemia said.",
        "\u201cIt\u2019s the most foolish thing I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d Nehemia said, scanning the ceiling as if she could see through the stone and into the glass sections.",
        "\u201cIndulge me,\u201d Nehemia pressed, smiling tightly.",
        "\u201cWhat are you doing here?\u201d Nehemia demanded in Eyllwe.",
        "\u201cHow about some basic swordplay instead?\u201d he asked Nehemia.",
        "Nehemia smiled, but not very well.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s lips trembled.",
        "\u201cWell, at least I\u2019m not the only one suffering,\u201d Nehemia said.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s voice was soft.",
        "Celaena became aware of Nehemia\u2019s personal guards standing in the doorway, their eyes gleaming.",
        "She had a hazy memory of Nehemia\u2019s fingers making strange symbols in the air.",
        "The mattress groaned and\u00a0sighed as Nehemia sat.",
        "Nehemia breathed hard, fighting to\u00a0get the words out.",
        "Nehemia was staring at her forehead, and Celaena asked, \u201cIs there dirt on my face?\u201d",
        "They appeared to be engaged in polite conversation, and Nehemia\u2019s guards stood to the side of the dais, already looking bored.",
        "Celaena straightened as Nehemia suddenly rose from her seat beside the queen\u2019s throne, her guards snapping to attention.",
        "\u201cYour Highness,\u201d Chaol said, stepping forward, a subtle movement to keep himself between Nehemia and Celaena.",
        "Cain and Verin laughed, but she and Nehemia walked away, the princess holding her hand tightly.",
        "\u201cDo you hunt?\u201d Nehemia interrupted in Eyllwe.",
        "Nehemia, the Light of Eyllwe, who would save them from their plight.",
        "Nehemia wept.",
        "\u201cLillian!\u201d It was Nehemia.",
        "Her dreams last night had been filled with Nehemia and Elena\u2014though, more often than not, they disappeared into visions of demons and the dead.",
        "\u201cWhat is the point in being a princess of Eyllwe if I cannot help my people?\u201d Nehemia said.",
        "While Celaena could listen to Nehemia rant about the King of Adarlan for hours, they were in a garden\u2014other people might be listening.",
        "Something flickered in Nehemia\u2019s gaze.",
        "Nehemia played with a fold in her dress.",
        "Whatever Nehemia\u2019s involvement was, it wasn\u2019t with Cain.",
        "Nehemia examined the assassin, and Celaena knew she was taking in her clothes, her gait, her posture\u2014everything Celaena herself had observed about the princess already.",
        "Nehemia hadn\u2019t asked her again what had bitten her hand, but had stayed with her, curled up in bed as they talked long into the night.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d Nehemia said quickly.",
        "But Cain wasn\u2019t done, and his attention shifted to Nehemia.",
        "Nehemia laughed.",
        "\u201cAm I not Princess of Eyllwe?\u201d Nehemia interrupted in the common tongue.",
        "She grinned broadly, hoping Nehemia would stop looking so strange, and stop staring at her brow.",
        "But it wasn\u2019t Dorian or Nehemia, not even a page.",
        "\u201cCome,\u201d Nehemia said brightly.",
        "\u201cWhy is Princess Nehemia here?\u201d",
        "She couldn\u2019t warn Chaol\u2014because if she were wrong, then it would ruin not just her friendship with Nehemia, but also the princess\u2019s efforts at diplomacy.",
        "And while she\u2019d be more than happy if some dark force somehow destroyed Cain, Perrington, the king, and Kaltain Rompier, if Nehemia, or even Chaol and Dorian, were somehow harmed . . .",
        "Whatever Nehemia thought of the flock of guards that followed Celaena everywhere, she didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "Nehemia looked after Cain, and her dark eyes narrowed.",
        "She hadn\u2019t seen Nehemia since the ball last night, hadn\u2019t dared to approach her, or tell Chaol what she\u2019d learned.",
        "\u201cNo,\u201d Nehemia said curtly, and headed toward the hedges that bordered the courtyard.",
        "What had Nehemia seen that caused her to act that way?",
        "Hadn\u2019t Verin died just after he taunted her in front of Nehemia?",
        "A shudder went through Celaena, and she interrupted before Nehemia could say more.",
        "Nehemia took Celaena\u2019s hand in her warm, dry one.",
        "Celaena felt each of her heartbeats hammering in her veins as Nehemia wove through the crowd, her guards close behind\u2014and halted in front of Celaena and Chaol.",
        "\u201cIf I may,\u201d Nehemia said in Eyllwe, \u201cI\u2019d like to offer this to you instead.\u201d",
        "Across the great hall, Nehemia sat with the Queen of Adarlan, occasionally glancing in Celaena\u2019s direction.",
        "They completed their walk in silence, and when they parted ways, Celaena quickly wished Nehemia a pleasant evening before striding to her part of the castle.",
        "She\u2019d seen Nehemia\u2019s rooms; there were no signs of a demon beast lurking about, and nowhere in the castle where she could\u2014\nCelaena\u2019s eyes rose from the book.",
        "Though I bet that without you there, Nehemia will probably do the same\u2014so it won\u2019t look so bad if I leave early, too.\u201d",
        "How had she even considered that Nehemia\u2014Nehemia, of all people!\u2014would attack everyone?",
        "Nehemia sat in a chair nearby, staring at her.",
        "She didn\u2019t dare to look at Nehemia, and only hoped her understanding of the common language was still weak enough for her not to have understood.",
        "\u201cI sense much worry in you,\u201d Nehemia said suddenly, \u201cand I hear much that you do not say.",
        "Nehemia nodded, staring at a barren bush in front of them.",
        "Nehemia looked to Celaena.",
        "She\u2019d been willing to apologize to Chaol when he found her sparring with Nehemia that afternoon, but his behavior . . .",
        "\u201cIf you fail to return after that, I\u2019ll have Nehemia killed.",
        "Celaena had already spent one blistering summer in the heat of the Red Desert, but to tell Nehemia that would only invite difficult questions.",
        "Neither had Dorian, especially not after all his talk of using Nehemia as a hostage to get the Eyllwe rebels to cooperate.",
        "Celaena knew the name\u2014she had often heard the Eyllwe slaves in Endovier boast of Nehemia\u2019s beauty and bravery.",
        "He only sheathed his sword and bowed his head to Nehemia as she clapped Celaena on the shoulder before she walked off.",
        "\u201cI won\u2019t waste time dancing around the truth,\u201d Nehemia said.",
        "Celaena smiled slightly as Fleetfoot wagged her tail and licked Nehemia\u2019s arm.",
        "She found Nehemia beaming at her, and Celaena lifted her staff a little in salute.",
        "Carefully, watching Nehemia laugh as two dogs leapt upon her and buried her beneath tongues and wagging tails, the assassin opened the pen door and slipped inside.",
        "Nehemia beamed.",
        "She looked at no one as she descended the staircase, and even the Queen of Adarlan stood to see the late arrival, Nehemia also rising from her seat beside her.",
        "Nehemia studied her carefully.",
        "Perhaps Nehemia wouldn\u2019t do anything\u2014perhaps she was just being paranoid and ridiculous.",
        "Nehemia watched them from the floor, her brows raised, until one of her personal guards appeared at the gate.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s voice was tinted with annoyance, and Celaena gave her friend an apologetic look.",
        "Nehemia sighed and stood.",
        "Princess Nehemia cast a worried glance in Celaena\u2019s direction, but the assassin waved at her to resume her lesson with the Crown Prince.",
        "Yet Nehemia could easily be a cunning actress.",
        "Nehemia patted her hand.",
        "Chaol took another step toward Nehemia\u2014effectively blocking Celaena\u2019s path to Kaltain.",
        "Because it was Nehemia.",
        "Not in this chamber, where no one would find her, where Chaol would never know why she disappeared, and would forever curse her for it, where she\u2019d never get the chance to tell Nehemia she had been wrong.",
        "\u201cIt was originally a defense,\u201d Nehemia said, gently setting her hand on Celaena\u2019s good arm.",
        "Because Nehemia was her friend\u2014because Nehemia had wept when her people had been murdered, because she\u2019d come to her for comfort.",
        "Something could still happen\u2014even if Nehemia wasn\u2019t here, something could happen.",
        "If Nehemia were truly somehow behind the Champions\u2019 murders\u2014and worse, had some feral beast at her command to destroy them\u2014and also just learned about the massacre of her people . . . then what better place to punish Adarlan than at the ball, where so many of its royals would be celebrating and unguarded?",
        "But . . . but Nehemia?",
        "The king rose, his brows narrowed, and nearby, Nehemia gasped.",
        "Nehemia squeezed her hand.",
        "She felt guilty for leaving Nehemia out of the conversation for so long, and having the princess be fluent in both languages would be great fun.",
        "A cold breeze blew past them, making Nehemia\u2019s multitude of fine, thin braids sway.",
        "Yet an image came vividly to his mind: Nehemia handing Celaena her staff at the duel.",
        "Nehemia frowned at Celaena.",
        "Nehemia loved Eyllwe\u2014that was certainly true\u2014and Celaena knew there was nothing Nehemia wouldn\u2019t do to keep her country safe.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s shoulders rose and fell.",
        "As if those words broke the spell that had been holding the princess in place, Nehemia rushed into her arms.",
        "Nehemia pointed to the corner.",
        "\u201cI\u2019m glad we met, Lady Lillian,\u201d Nehemia said, her eyes bright.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s gaze lingered on Celaena\u2019s brow for a moment before she grinned.",
        "If she hit him . . . If she hit him, if she got into a brawl right here and the guards had to pull them apart, Chaol might not let her see Nehemia again, let alone leave her rooms after lessons, or stay late to practice with Nox.",
        "Someone stepped beside Dorian, and from her intake of breath, he knew it was Nehemia.",
        "\u201cYou look beautiful, Lillian,\u201d Nehemia said in the common tongue, her accent as thick as it had ever been.",
        "Nehemia kissed the top of her head before walking to the door, Fleetfoot in tow.",
        "Since her initial meeting with Princess Nehemia, she hadn\u2019t seen or heard from the princess\u2014not even chatter from the servants.",
        "And Princess Nehemia would be left alone with moronic company, and, well . . .",
        "Nehemia, seated at a small desk, stared at her with wide eyes.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s mouth parted.",
        "\u201cWho is he?\u201d Nehemia asked in Eyllwe.",
        "Tears dripped from Nehemia\u2019s cheeks and onto her white dress.",
        "Just yesterday, the duke presented a plan: they would deploy more legions, and keep Nehemia here to discourage any retaliation from the rebels.",
        "Nehemia wouldn\u2019t repay pain with more pain.",
        "But if Nehemia left before she was supposed to, the duke would know who had told her, and inform his father.",
        "Nehemia, they whispered, who smuggled information and supplies to the rebel groups hiding in Eyllwe.",
        "\u201cThey massacred them,\u201d Nehemia whispered, her eyes wide.",
        "Alone in her rooms, Celaena was about to see what her new companion was up to when the thought struck her:\nNehemia would be at the ball.",
        "She couldn\u2019t confront Nehemia\u2014not without more concrete proof, not without ruining everything.",
        "She had woken up so early\u2014and slept so little after that encounter with Nehemia . . .",
        "Nehemia nodded.",
        "\u201cHow are you feeling?\u201d Nehemia replied in the common tongue, without a hint of her accent.",
        "Nehemia clicked her tongue.",
        "Nehemia couldn\u2019t read books that advanced, not when she still stumbled through lines of text.",
        "The door finished opening and Nehemia, clad in a gold-worked wonder, stood before her.",
        "\u201cYou look troubled,\u201d Nehemia said when Celaena reached her side, and put a hand on her arm.",
        "Nehemia looked at her for a long moment, her eyes shining with what seemed like pain, and then left.",
        "\u201cThat is not important,\u201d Nehemia interrupted.",
        "She whirled around, to the direction where Nehemia had disappeared.",
        "Nehemia leaned in to whisper in Celaena\u2019s ear.",
        "And while Nehemia might be playing a game that she had no chance of winning, Dorian couldn\u2019t deny that he greatly admired the princess for daring to play in the first place.",
        "Celaena shot Nehemia a look, but the princess\u2019s eyes remained upon Cain\u2014narrowed, but her lips strangely slack.",
        "Nehemia chewed on the words and then looked to Celaena, brows high\u2014as if she\u2019d expected a translation by now.",
        "She wouldn\u2019t ruin it with thoughts of Nehemia, or of the duel, or of the ball she wasn\u2019t allowed to attend tonight.",
        "Fleetfoot, done licking and sniffing at Nehemia, curled up in a ball between them and went to sleep.",
        "Because if Nehemia had truly lied to her like that, and if Nehemia was murdering the Champions, then Celaena had to see it herself.",
        "A smile tugged on the edges of Nehemia\u2019s full lips.",
        "Nehemia took a seat on the edge of the mattress.",
        "Then she could keep an eye on Nehemia all night.",
        "But you can\u2019t have Princess Nehemia here with you.\u201d",
        "But his father never did anything without a reason\u2014and from the few words he\u2019d exchanged with Nehemia, he couldn\u2019t help but wonder if she had her own motivations in coming here, too.",
        "She almost sighed with relief, though the guilt of what she\u2019d done\u2014how little faith she\u2019d had in Nehemia\u2014still made her a tad miserable.",
        "Days passed without seeing Nehemia, and Celaena kept her mouth shut about the incident to Chaol or Dorian or anyone who visited her chambers.",
        "\u201cI heard about Nehemia.\u201d",
        "\u201cWhat\u2019s your obsession with these ugly things?\u201d Nehemia asked from beside her.",
        "Nehemia laughed, and Dorian\u2019s face warmed.",
        "\u201cI\u2019ve never seen snow,\u201d Nehemia said, looking at the sky.",
        "I know there are rumors about Nehemia\u2019s connection to the rebels in Eyllwe, but . . . but I\u2019d like to think that if my country was conquered, I would stop at nothing to win back my people\u2019s freedom, too.\u201d",
        "Dorian was many things, but he wasn\u2019t stupid; had he realized the symbolism in Nehemia\u2019s offer?",
        "And, Celaena realized, through Georgina, Nehemia would also get the King of Adarlan\u2019s ear.",
        "Your friend, Nehemia, needs you here.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s shoulders slumped slightly.",
        "With Nehemia gone, she still had to keep watch, but maybe she could attempt to have a little fun, too.",
        "Nehemia strained as she carried Celaena into the bathing pool, where she stripped away Celaena\u2019s clothes.",
        "Nehemia held her in the water, rocking back and forth.",
        "\u201cThat man cares for you more than either of you realize,\u201d Nehemia said, a smile in her voice.",
        "Princess Nehemia approached, clapping.",
        "But Nehemia came from a conquered kingdom.",
        "Nehemia contemplated the question.",
        "How could she ever have believed Nehemia was the one killing the Champions?",
        "Nehemia and her creature must have been creeping around down here, just floors below everyone else.",
        "Nehemia, who might someday pose a threat to the King of Adarlan\u2019s rule over her home country when she ascended to the throne.",
        "Nehemia only deigned to give him a terse nod.",
        "There was something inherently peaceful about the day, despite the darkness of her encounter with Nehemia.",
        "The duke and Kaltain sat on the other side of the aisle, and behind them were Nehemia and several others she didn\u2019t recognize.",
        "\u201cYou\u2019re quiet today,\u201d Nehemia said.",
        "Given what she\u2019d heard of Nehemia, Celaena didn\u2019t think that was the entirety of it, but she smiled politely as she said, \u201cHow long will you remain in Rifthold?\u201d",
        "\u201cYou should leave it alone,\u201d Nehemia said sharply, and Celaena blinked.",
        "\u201cI was in the garden with Nehemia\u2014with my guards, don\u2019t worry\u2014and he approached us.",
        "Nehemia straightened.",
        "Even if Nehemia wasn\u2019t going to hurt anyone tonight, that didn\u2019t prove her innocence.",
        "Celaena cocked her head as Nehemia emerged to stand along the sidelines of the large white circle.",
        "Nehemia stroked Fleetfoot\u2019s coat.",
        "Princess Nehemia smiled slowly, and the others gaped.",
        "\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be sorry,\u201d she said, not wanting to speak about the horrors that she\u2019d seen, or of Kaltain\u2019s treachery, or what Nehemia had confided in her.",
        "Nehemia\u2019s eyes widened.",
        "\u201cFor all the horrid things you said yesterday afternoon when I was sparring with Nehemia.\u201d",
        "Nehemia didn\u2019t break her stare.",
        "Nehemia didn\u2019t say anything.",
        "As\u00a0far as ambassadors went, Nehemia wasn\u2019t exactly the best choice.",
        "Nehemia had saved her; how had she dared to believe that Nehemia might be the one controlling that creature?",
        "\u201cThis is Her Royal Highness the Princess Nehemia Ytger of Eyllwe.\u201d",
        "Princess Nehemia was safely in her chambers, surrounded by her guards.",
        "How could he ever look Nehemia in the face again?",
        "Nehemia had long since returned to her own rooms, tears dried and shoulders squared once more.",
        "She could only imagine how Nehemia would react to such temperatures.",
        "She still held on to the remnant of Nehemia\u2019s staff, as if it were a rock in the middle of a violent sea.",
        "Nehemia gave her a weighing look.",
        "We\u2019d be better off trying to win over Nehemia\u2014trying to work with her to get the rebels to back off.",
        "Her gaze shifted to Nehemia, whose fierce and graceful eyes warmed the marrow of her bones and steadied her arms.",
        "Nehemia raised her chin in a way that suggested saying no wasn\u2019t an option.",
        "He\u2019d stopped by last night, but Nehemia had shooed him off before he could enter the bedroom.",
        "\u201cA word of what?\u201d Nehemia said sharply, blinking back her tears.",
        "Unless Nehemia was here to start something bigger\u2014unless she didn\u2019t want to make sure the king spared Eyllwe at all.",
        "He turned to Nehemia.",
        "Eventually Nehemia turned to her.",
        "Nehemia let out a strangled sob, and a part of Celaena broke at the agony in the sound.",
        "Nehemia was still sitting with the queen, and hadn\u2019t looked again in Celaena\u2019s direction.",
        "Dorian Havilliard smiled at her as Nehemia took a seat.",
        "Nehemia was exactly where she\u2019d been standing before, smiling faintly, only\u2014",
        "\u201cExcept for the Princess Nehemia.\u201d",
        "Nehemia had every reason to deceive them, to plot against them.",
        "She and Nehemia took up behind him, and as they crossed the small patio in which the clock tower stood, Celaena looked at the spot where Cain had just been kneeling.",
        "\u201cNehemia?\u201d Celaena asked, getting to her feet.",
        "Celaena had Nehemia read from her library books, and then forced her to copy letter after letter until they looked flawless.",
        "Princess Nehemia lunged, slapping Dorian on the wrist with her sword.",
        "Nehemia looked up at the ceiling.",
        "\u201cSmeared?\u201d Nehemia said, her voice dropping into a hush.",
        "Nehemia might not be fully versed in their language, but she was smart enough to know the power of saying those two words.",
        "It was then that Celaena noticed the piece of paper in Nehemia\u2019s hands.",
        "And the people of Eyllwe were being kidnapped in the night and sold into slavery, right along with the rebels that rumor claimed Nehemia supported so fiercely.",
        "Nehemia just looked at her, damning her with that blank stare.",
        "As if the dog understood, she jumped off the bed and sat at Nehemia\u2019s feet.",
        "Why was Elena here, and what was Nehemia doing at the edge of the circle, her hands moving about so strangely?",
        "Perhaps he knew what sort of threat Nehemia posed; but why bring her to the castle?",
        "\u201cThank you, Nehemia,\u201d she said with sincerity.",
        "Nehemia was no fool; like him, she knew that symbols held a special kind of power.",
        "Nehemia cleared her throat.",
        "Though with Nehemia\u2019s passion for hunting, I can\u2019t say I\u2019m surprised she finally dragged you along.\u201d",
        "When Nehemia had left, Celaena smiled, despite all that she had just learned, and closed her eyes.",
        "Celaena\u2019s throat tightened, and she put a hand on Nehemia\u2019s shoulder.",
        "Nehemia gave him the withering glare that usually made people start sweating.",
        "Nehemia nodded gravely.",
        "But why would Nehemia plot against her?",
        "She felt Nehemia\u2019s hand on her shoulder, but she shrugged it off as she took another step toward him, close enough for the curls of his breath to touch her face.",
        "Nehemia was a force to be reckoned with.",
        "\u201cI can imagine a great deal,\u201d Nehemia said softly.",
        "But convincing Chaol to let her see Nehemia was always a hassle\u2014because he insisted on being there to keep watch.",
        "\u201cAre these all hunting dogs?\u201d Celaena asked, but Nehemia had disappeared.",
